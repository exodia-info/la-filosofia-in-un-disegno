## <span style={{color:'black'}}>_THE PHILOSOPHERS PORTRAITS_</span>


_The philosophers drawings are a purely personal and recreational project that aims to create a sort of union between art and philosophy. The charm of the philosophical personalities who characterized the thought of the 19th century is the seed from which this work originates; it is about expressing the greatness of the personalities, the depth of thought, the influence of the reflections of these 7 thinkers through large illustrations. In fact, the drawings never sacrifice the aesthetic side, even if they try to best express the main concepts of the authors' philosophy. The basic idea is that the thought of these timeless characters can be artistically transformed into the fulcrum of an intellectual universe that takes shape on the sheet. It should be specified first of all that the study on which I based myself to create these illustrations is an in-depth study but still manualistic; practically no reference is made to a specific thought or a quote from the author taken from a certain work. The most important writings are however mentioned and the main concepts reported within them are specified, as well as fundamental for understanding the author's thought; in some cases the works are even fundamental (as for the description of Marx's drawing, or that of Schopenhauer) whose contents are exposed in a summary way. Furthermore, these drawings are extremely technical: with the aim of rendering the meaning of certain reflections as figuratively as possible, I also designed the illustrations using light effects (Comte, Bergson etc.), changes in perspective (Nietzsche), holes in the sheet (Schopenhauer) and also a system of tiles that translate between them (Kierkegaard). In short, everything that falls within these illustrations is designed to give life to aesthetically appreciable artistic compositions, but everything still remains equipped with a philosophical meaning; every color, every shape, every subject has a representative sense in the structure of the author's thought. To be clear, these illustrations are the artistic translation of the great reflections that have marked the history of nineteenth-century philosophy, with particular attention to an exaltation of the concrete figures of these characters. So much so that in each drawing, the portrait of the author is always present as the undisputed protagonist of the illustration and in addition his image on a visual level fits perfectly with the composition of his thoughts. In fact, we want to emphasize the fact that the personality, the figure, the image of the philosopher goes hand in hand with his philosophy, his reflections, his ideological structures, all translated into an artistic universe imbued with conceptuality and meanings. You might think that what pushed me to deal with these works is a sort of "cult or adoration of the personalities" of these philosophers, but it is not exactly like that: the image of the philosopher, combined with his reflections and the way of expressing them with metaphors and analogies, certainly has its bursting charm, but this does not mean focusing only (and excessively) on the personality of the author. Each description contains in fact a contextualization of the thought of the philosopher in question, as well as a reference to its effects throughout history (think of Nietzsche's drawing, or Marx's) to better understand the reflections also from a historical perspective. It is obvious that the illustration has as its protagonist the author and his philosophical world, certainly not a current of thought or a philosophical tradition. Finally, it is specified that no reference is ever made to any biographical event of the character except in very rare cases relevant to his thought or limited references regarding important information about his life (such as Nietzsche's birth and death dates). To conclude, these 7 drawings are "artistic-conceptual journeys" into the philosophical universe of these great authors, constructed with the use of shapes, colors, scenarios, metaphors, images, light effects, perspectives and various technical devices.
The descriptions are divided into paragraphs for a better organization of the explanations, which are always preceded by an introductory part on the historical-philosophical contextualization of the author's thought, as well as general clarifications on the drawing. We are therefore ready to catapult ourselves into the gloomy oriental world of Arthur Schopenhauer, into the distressing universe of Soren Aabye Kierkegaard, into the atheist scenario of Feuerbach's thought, into the revolutionary horizon of Karl Marx, into the new anthropological-scientific framework of August Comte, into the spiritual dimension of Henri Bergson and finally into the chaotic and disturbing kingdom of Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche._

The illustrations are collected according to a precise classification that takes into account the philosophical-cultural panorama preceding (think of the contribution of Hegelian philosophy) and contemporary to these authors:

* <Link href={'#shopenhauer-kierkegaard'} >AGAINST HEGELIAN IDEALISM</Link> &rarr; Schopenhauer - Kierkegaard
* <Link href={'#feuerbach-marx'}>THE TRADITION LATER TO HEGEL</Link>  &rarr; Feuerbach - Marx
* <Link href={'#comte-bergson'}>INDUSTRIALIZATION AND PROGRESS: POSITIVISM AND SPIRITUALISM</Link>  &rarr; Comte - Bergson
* <Link href={'#nietzsche'}>THE CRISIS OF PHILOSOPHICAL CERTAINTIES</Link>  &rarr; Nietzsche
