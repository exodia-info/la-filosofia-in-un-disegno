     _Imagine having a sheet of notes or a diagram in front of you and at a certain point, as if by magic, every single concept reported becomes part of a huge illustration of what you are studying.
     In a nutshell, this is what I tried to do with these drawings concerning 7 19th century philosophers: the illustrations were conceived and designed to translate on a figurative level what is most abstract in reality, thought. The drawings can be useful as a study aid or as suitable tools for correctly understanding the work of the philosophers in question.
     However, it should be specified that these drawings must not be taken as intended for the purpose of a study of the thoughts of the author in question (since reference is made several times to personal interpretations of the thoughts), but rather as attempts to materialize an immortal personality as that of these characters. After all, not only what the author theorizes is represented, but he himself also takes part in the composition with his portrait. In short, the entire world behind these fascinating 19th century intellectuals who marked history is highlighted: we distinguish their physical aspect, integrated with the philosophical world. These two ingredients are the basis for completing the aim set with this work: opening a window into the mind of high-sounding personalities like those of these thinkers using only symbolic and conceptualized images. Of course, it must be admitted that sometimes there are writings (or signs) that help the understanding and synthesis of some concepts, but they predominantly concern only the focal terms of the theories analyzed (for example Kierkegaard's anguish, Schopenhauer's will or even Bergson's conscience). In addition to what objectively stands out on the sheet, it is also necessary to underline the technical devices linked to the interpretation of the drawing itself: some must be illuminated, others upside down and others still have moving parts. This means that they not only respond to a certain correspondence between thought and figure, but also between interpretation of thought and vision of the figure; in some cases we could say that the general and overall reading of the author's philosophy is reflected in the observation of the drawing, to which however a "condensation of the concepts themselves" belongs._

     _To conclude everything makes sense, from the color used, to the figures represented, from their positions, to the formulated reading of the illustration: all this is what makes the drawings illustrating the thoughts of Arthur Schopenhauer, Soren Aabye Kierkegaard, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl congenial Marx, Auguste Comte, Henri Bergson and Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche._
