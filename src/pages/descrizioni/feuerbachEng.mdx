# <span className='feuerbach'>FEUERBACH</span>: THE ATHEISM OF THE YOUNG HEGELIANS

After Hegel's death, his followers divided into two different and opposing lines of thought: the Hegelian Right in which philosophy justifies current religion and politics; the **young hegelians** in which philosophy denies religion and existing institutions.

In particular, the second current saw as its progenitor one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century, founder of 19th century **philosophical atheism** and protagonist of the illustration: **Ludwig Feuerbach**. Through the drawing we will analyze his philosophy, founded on a thought that is both atheistic and revolutionary.

## Tipping over

The origin of Feuerbach's philosophy is the understanding of the erroneous **predicative relationships** analyzed by Hegel and the followers of the Hegelian Right: according to the atheist philosopher, Idealism is the creator of the error which places as **subject what is attribute** and vice versa.

The objective is therefore to correct this inconvenience with the use of philosophy by once again overturning the so-called "predicative relationships" and ** denying religion once and for all ** (with his beliefs).
The drawing was designed from this need: the **portrait of Feuerbach** looms large near the left margin of the sheet (Hegelian Left), while everything else seems to be organized between the two **halves**, turned upside down compared to to the other.

In fact, the reading of the drawing must begin by **turning the sheet upside down with respect to the image of the philosopher and observing the **bottom box**, in which the **incorrect relationship** between God and man is narrated, in which the first of the two still exists while the second lives in the conviction of being the creation of the first (to which he subjects himself as we will see): to be clear here God is the subject and man is the predicate of God.

Once you have finished reading the first box, it is essential to reverse the drawing in order to understand the **overlying half**: it is precisely this "**reversal of the sheet**" which translates at a congenial level the "reversal of preaching relationships" and leads us to observe what is consistent with Feuerbach's vision and now in fact his image is also **straight**: it is the new man, aware of his own qualities (positive predicates) and freed from the dominion of the illusory image of God; man is therefore now ** aware ** of being the subject while God is a predicate of him, that is, a creation of his mind.

## The image of God…

After having turned the sheet over, the box must be observed from top to bottom.

The first image to be displayed is that of **God**, surrounded by a sacred yellow halo and in the guise of a man (beard, long hair and white and red robe are usually the classic features of the "God who became man ” according to Christian beliefs) since the illusory image of God himself leads one to even believe that he existed in **concrete form** in the history of the world.
We note that the divine image rises above a **cloud** which has a double meaning: it is **thought** of the puppet below (which we will analyze in the next paragraph) but it is also **detachment* * compared to what is below.

In particular, this last meaning is connected with the consideration of the man of God, that is, that of an **absolute detachment**, of an impossible perfection and of an unconditional sacredness which although lead the believing man to have faith, On the other hand, they highlight an accentuated distance from man himself who considers himself imperfect (remember that all this is pure religious belief, therefore incorrect according to Feuerbach).

## …and alienation

Closely linked to the image of God in the drawing is the concept of "**alienation**", concretized in the figure of the **manipulated puppet**.

The latter is a sad representation of the alienated man, that is to say that pathological state according to which the believer "**splitting himself**", projects a superior image outside of himself, that of God and in addition to firmly believing in his existence, he subjects himself to it with the most cruel and humiliating practices (rites, chastity, sacrifices, prayers, etc.).

Consequently, in Feuerbach's vision man **submits** himself to God convinced that he is the creation and not the creator as actually happens: hence the iconic figure of the dehumanized individual, reduced to a wooden puppet with the * *head bowed** as a sign of excessive obedience and manipulated by means of strings by his "illusory puppeteer", namely God.
Furthermore, the cloud anticipated previously indicates that the thought of the puppet itself is aimed at projecting outside itself the divinity to which it submits, as if God is only an idea which however commands and dominates its own creator in Feuerbach's atheistic vision.
To accentuate the humiliating character of the puppet (which has very little human about it) the "alienation" sign was hung around the neck as if it were the sign used by lords in ancient times to specify the price of a slave to buyers, a role of submission attributed by Feuerbach to the believer.

## The causes of the birth of the idea of God

Proceeding downwards you will be able to notice three different distinct representations to which the extensions of God's white robe are connected: these are the **causes of the birth of the image of God**, clearly expressed by Feuerbach and readable from left to right in the drawing.

• The first deals with the contrast between the "**infinite will**" and the "**finite power**" of man, according to which the human being (more precisely the Christian believer) has infinite desires but his will without limits he cannot be satisfied in his power, as it is limited. Hence the need to project a figure that **can do everything** and where all desires are realizable, that is, a divine entity such as God.
By virtue of this the illustration would also be explained: a small **white man** (personification of the human species) who, despite standing above the **pedestal** of "wanting", suffers the weight of the overlying **boulder ** of “power”.

• The second scene is inherent to the "**imaginary personification of the qualities of the species**": man feels limited as an individual, but not as a species and this is why those very qualities that humanity recognizes as perfect cannot belong to man in the sense of individual, but in the sense of human kind. Thus the image of God is born, in which the qualities of the species coincide in a single figure**, representative of a perfect, therefore divine, entity.

The perfect qualities defined by Feuerbach are **love**, **wisdom** and **will** reported in the drawing in the form of small characters with a **golden body** (to accentuate the character of perfection ) and with the head replaced by significant icons: the **heart** for love, the **light bulb** for wisdom and the **crown** for will.

• Third and final cause is the adoration of all those things that in nature have led man to live and **survive** and consequently recognize a **divine creator**: here he stands in front of two * *white hominids** intent on the act of **venerating** (man's dependence on nature), a **bare tree** at the ends of the branches of which there are symbolic natural elements surrounded by a light halo.
In particular, each of them has had a primary function in the sustenance of human beings since primordial times: the **drop** indicates the **water** used by man to drink; the **leaf** indicates **nature** with its beings and therefore food and resources for human beings; the blue **snail** indicates the **air** breathed by men; the **flame** is instead the **fire** used by man to warm himself and protect himself from the deadly cold.

To further reiterate the causes of God's birth, a **table** was created near his head, reporting in written form the three reasons just explained.

## Anthropology turned upside down

After having established what the image of God is, how it is experienced by men and above all why it was born, Feuerbach fully states that religion is **anthropology turned upside down**: the time has therefore come to use **philosophy** to achieve previously trampled moral honesty, the time has come to overturn the erroneous preaching reports by correcting them and thus explain the mystery of theology with anthropology.

This is how the drawing is turned upside down in line with Feuerbach's vision, or rather his portrait, and the upper panel is thus observed.

## A new deity called “man”

Through philosophy, man reclaims his positive predicates, his essence and his **freedom**: it is no coincidence that the protagonist of the second panel is a **stylized man**.
The head is turned **upwards** (and no longer bowed as a sign of humiliation) as the individual reclaims himself and the **species qualities** previously mentioned and now **supported ideologically and symbolically on the left hand**.

It should be noted that the anthropomorphic figure is colored **flesh pink** for two reasons: first of all, the "**new man**" is no longer a dehumanized puppet but a vigorous and aware being, whose power is enhanced by the bright color of his limbs; secondly, Feuerbach does not consider man as pure spirituality (unlike Hegel), but as a concrete being who lives, experiences feelings and above all manifests himself in the world as a being **of flesh and blood** (taken from the pink color of skin).

All this leads to another fundamental point, represented in the drawing as a real "**defeat of Hegelian Idealism**": in the drawing the man seems to hit with a **fist** a sort of spirit dressed as God but with the **face of Hegel**.
This iconography symbolizes that Feuerbach openly criticizes Hegelianism as a sort of **masked theology** and therefore also guilty (as we have already said at the beginning) of having established wrong predicative relationships, in which Hegel's spirit coincides philosophically to the religious image of God.
This is why in the drawing the spirit with Hegel's face is **dressed like God** and if you look more carefully it is even **connected** to his figure thanks to a thin white filament that passes from one box to another .

By virtue of what we have just said, that new man is not only defeating the Hegelian spirit represented in the act of **dissolving** towards the left coherently with the flow of the wind, but also God and the **collar** that gives him is about to break its neck in favor of a conscious freedom.
However, one of the fundamental elements of the representation is the **lace** held by the hand of the Hegelian spirit and tied to the broken metal collar: thanks to the awareness, man becomes free and the destruction of that collar that bound him to domination under a sacred image, transforms **the rope into a luminous halo** that crowns the man's head.

Here we have come to affirm the positive component of Feuerbach's atheism, that is, the proposal of a new divinity: **man**, also the protagonist of a new philosophy.

## The philosophy of the future

In contrast to the previous philosophy (theologizing and full of idealism), Feuerbach celebrates the advent of the "philosophy of the future", shown on the **wooden sign** at the top of the drawing.
It has the characteristics of a "**naturalistic humanism**", according to which man is the **object** of the new philosophizing and nature is the **reality on which everything depends**, including man.
From here we can understand the importance attributed to the pink hominid in the **foreground** (man) who stands in front of a **natural panorama** (nature), which acts as a background (and as we will see hides several meanings).

In the last phase of his thought Feuerbach delves into the philosophy of the future by talking about love and society.

## Love and philosophical communism

There are still some brief concepts to be clarified in the drawing. The large **heart** colored with different shades of pink behind the man clarifies Feuerbach's thoughts regarding **love**: the latter is a fundamental passion that is one with life and on a figurative level it is a hollow heart, open at the bottom left to connect the human figure with the background, that is, to create a **whole**.

Finally, the **sign** on the left in the foreground shows the writing "philosophical communism": in Feuerbach's philosophy of the future, this formula is nothing other than the social essence of man according to which **the self cannot live without you**.
On the sign in the drawing, apparently you can read an "i" and a "u" and next to them some empty spaces: **illuminating** the drawing from behind will reveal the "o" of the word "I" and the "t" of the word "you" but when the "I" is completely visualized, it is inevitable that the "t" is also revealed and therefore the "you" is also seen. Here we return to the previous statement, namely that the I cannot exist (in the drawing be seen) without the you.

## The artistic-conceptual function of the landscape

As we have already said, the landscape behind it represents the role of nature in the so-called "naturalistic humanism" of the philosophy of the future. However it has further concepts carried over into it.

Obviously as a background, it primarily has an **artistic function**.
Going further, however, it will be possible to observe all the elements previously mentioned as objects of natural veneration in the third cause of the birth of the idea of God: the **trees** for the leaf, the **wind** for the blue snail, the **fire** for the flame and **waterfall** for the drop. All those elements considered God's creation for man in theologizing thought are now what makes man linked to nature and life in the already specified "naturalistic humanism" and this is why they take part in the landscape.

Beyond this, a further concept is reiterated by the **trees** and how they follow one another from left to right: initially they are **fir trees**, traditionally used at Christmas to celebrate the birth of the son of God but proceeding to the right the expanse of fir trees ends and leaves room for **cypresses**, symbol of ascension towards God. However, what is found above the cypresses is the **human being** and the act of ascension does not it leads more to an otherworldly God, but to Feuerbach's new atheistic divinity: man himself.
This means that the trees retrace the thought of Feuerbach who, with his atheistic analyses, disintegrates the **idea of God** (fir trees) and finally arrives at the **philosophy of the future** (cypresses).

## The heavens

To conclude the description of the drawing, we need to make a brief specification about the **skies** in one and the other box.

If you observe the drawing without turning it over both before and after, you will realize that **the blue is always at the bottom and the blue at the top**, i.e. the erroneous vision of believing that religion coincides with anthropology (i.e. believing that God became man and exists forever).
Since the illustration must be observed by reversing the drawing twice, the colors of the sky will **exchange** by position, where first the blue is closest to the ground line and then the light blue will be closer: this symbolizes and reiterates the Feuerbachian consideration of theology as an upside-down anthropology.
All this obviously does not deny that the light blue shades used in the sky also have an aesthetic and **artistic** function.
