# SCHOPENHAUER: AN ANTI-IDEALISTIC PESSIMISM

** Arthur Schopenhauer ** is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most renowned personalities of nineteenth-century philosophy: his thought is included in those radical ** criticisms of Hegelian idealism **, together with Kierkegaard.
Schopenhauer's philosophy is a cosmic pessimistic vision that the Polish thinker fully expresses in the writing "**The world as will and representation**" and which on a figurative level translates into drawing.
A characteristic of the illustration inherent to Schopenhauer's philosophy is that it is completely colored with **dull colors** and dark (the philosopher's face itself seems to be particularly pale): this artistically translates the dark lens through which the Polish philosopher observes and interprets the world and the only act in which that **pessimism** that runs through the entire drawing finds a respite is in correspondence with the three cavities (top left), i.e. the paths of liberation in which the colors they light up.

## The general reading of the drawing

Schopenhauer's drawing is difficult to understand when reading.

The starting point is the face of the philosopher, whose eyes are covered by the famous "veil of Maya", then we come to observe the cosmic pyramid ending with a dark image of a man emerging from the wooden floor of the room above. At that point the individual representations must be read up to the colorful "ways of liberation".
In short, imagining an ideal reading path, it is a "**mirror C**", which passes from the interpretation of the **external world** (phenomenon) to **living interiority** in the wooden room (noumenon) in which the "will" dominates like an enormous black ink stain.

## The veil of Maya

Schopenhauer's pale face has his gaze covered by a dark gray blindfold: this is the metaphor of the "**veil of Maya**" used by the pessimistic thinker to distinguish the **phenomenon** from the **noumenon**.
The first is what lives in the subjective representation of the individual and is articulated in the phenomenal multiplicity of the world, while the second is the essence of universal existence, hidden under that veil.

Schopenhauer, like every human individual, is initially excluded from ** authentic ** and noumenal knowledge and the observation of the world always takes place through that veil of Maya (which blindfolds her eyes); having your eyes blindfolded and seeing only the phenomenal veil of Maya means reiterating the limits of an external and superficial vision but above all a subjective representation.

For this reason, the figurative choice to present the face of the blindfolded philosopher is closely linked to the concept of **representation**, in which the **representing subject** (the individual now embodied in the portrait of the philosopher) and the **object represented** (the veil) are the sides of the same coin and as such must be enclosed in the same figurative representation (the image of Schopenhauer).

To conclude, the blindfold transforms below into the gloomy dress of a woman in front of the left shoulder of the philosopher's portrait: that oriental female figure is **Maya** and best concretizes the metaphor just explained.

## Space, time and causality: the windows of the dream of life

The bandage behind Schopenhauer's head is linked to three fundamental elements for the phenomenal interpretation of the world: a **ruler** (space), a **clock** (time) and an **insignia “cause”* * (causality).
These are the a priori forms that accompany our mind and which are therefore linked to the **interpretation** of phenomena, i.e. the veil of Maya.

But the essence of reality is found under the veil of Maya, beyond phenomenal plurality and outside the a priori forms mentioned here.
Here we come to Schopenhauer's disturbing consideration of **life as a dream**, that is to say an illusion which is only apparently an authentic reality: this concept is presented in the drawing behind the cosmic pyramid.
Behind its thick black outline, in contrast with the dark gray background, there is **a hollow sleeping head** (with the symbolic red dot on the forehead, a sign of oriental influences in Schopenhauer's thought), a figurative icon of the dream experience articulated at the top with the presence of an **eye**, which with its visual ray hits the silhouette of a gazelle bearing the writing "idea" (but we will talk about this later).
Note that the eye is supported above a dreaming **cloud coming from the head** since "life as a dream" is linked to the fact that the observed phenomena (the eye and its visual ray) live in the our **subjective representation** and therefore in that dreaming mind.

Before concluding the analysis of this part of the drawing, it is essential to specify the role of the **white clouds** at the bottom margin of the sheet: they accentuate living external (connected to the phenomena) indicating that we are in an **external environment** (and not internal like the part above); on the other hand they accentuate the **dreamlike character** of life by creating an artistic and general dreamlike atmosphere.

## Living from the inside

Before proceeding with the explanation of the analysis of the cosmic pyramid, it is necessary to understand what type of classification this same pyramid is; its meaning is based on the concept of "**will to live**" or more generally of "will", represented as an **ink stain** in the wooden room.

In fact, Schopenhauer states that in order to pierce the apparent veil of Maya, it is necessary to go beyond external living and start living oneself internally, in the acts one performs and therefore try to enter that **internal environment** represented in the drawing .

All this is only possible thanks to Schopenhauer's innovative consideration of the ego, which goes beyond Hegel's idealism: the ego is now **consciousness**, **will** and **body**.
These three meanings coincide in the anthropomorphic image placed at the top of the cosmic pyramid; in fact, the individual opens a sort of door in his left arm, almost as if to enhance the concreteness of his own limbs (body) and two rivers of black ink emerge from it, one connected to the noumenal essence of the world (will), the other connected to the eye of the subjective representation of the world (consciousness).

It is important to remember that will is **the root of the world**, not of man alone and therefore its black ink branches out in different directions, fully surrounding the cosmic pyramid and therefore all of nature.
Here it is the principle in which evil resides and which leads to the first pessimistic point of Schopenhauer's philosophy: all beings **live to live**, without any other significant purpose.

## The cosmic pyramid: “the more intelligence you have, the more you will suffer”

Returning below and out of the room, we begin to pay attention to the **cosmic pyramid**, readable from bottom to top.
Schopenhauer states that the will manifests itself in two moments: the **individuals** of the natural world and the **ideas** (archetypes) on which they are shaped.

In the drawing, in fact, "the idea" is contained in the **shape of the head of a gazelle\***, then taken up in the section of the animals of the cosmic pyramid as a result of the projection of the visual ray of the eye: in short, the * *idea of gazelle** shapes the animal gazelle thanks to consciousness and representation.
Returning instead to the pyramid, it presents an **ascending classification** with respect to the objectivization of the will and sees from the lowest to the highest level the **forces of nature**, the **plants**, the **animals ** and finally the **man**.

This classification leads the philosopher to establish that the being in which the will is **most aware** is man and since it is what the evil of the world derives from (seen as chaotic and painful), the human being it is the natural **most suffering** individual (tear near the eye). If the more the will gains in awareness, the more it loses in security, then Schopenhauer's maxim (which is extremely current) "the more intelligent you are, the more you will suffer" is fully verified, valid not only in the relationship between man and nature, but also between man and man. man.
This pearl of wisdom is reported on a **wooden sign** near the man at the tip of the pyramid.
Furthermore, by virtue of this awareness, man is the only one capable of **living himself from within** and this is why he is the only being who enters the wooden room, bursting through the floor.

## An unconscious, unique, eternal and free black spot

The protagonist of the room is, as we have already defined, the "**will**", the principle in which resides the **evil** itself which characterizes the world and which occurs throughout nature: it thus extends through **long filaments of black ink**, which like the arms of an octopus envelop every part of the drawing.
Schopenhauer defines the characteristics of this will.

• The will is **unconscious**, that is to say an energy or impulse without any consciousness (without a targeted will) and this is why it is presented raw in the drawing, **without form** or specific contours: yes it's about a **dark energy** that runs through the illustration from head to toe.

• The will is also **unique** (outside space), that is to say that the different acts under which it is hidden are produced by the same force and in fact on the sheet the stain is **only one** even though its branching is multiple and originates from a single branch.

• It is also **eternal** (outside time) and for this reason in the writing, in correspondence with the second "o" of "will" there is the **symbol of infinity**, with obvious reference to its condition storm.

• To conclude the definition of will, it is **uncaused** (outside causality) and free, that is, without purpose beyond itself (beyond living): this principle is represented in a figurative way through **broken chains** above the will, to indicate that it is not limited by a cause and an end, but is in fact purely free.

## The love

Up to now we have clarified all the ramifications of the black will; only the branch remains retained in the room, flowing towards the right.
The black ink soils and apparently shatters a part of the wall: a greenish **hand** emerges from the breach, the "**cold genius of the species**", a term used by Schopenhauer to indicate the will to live in the natural environment .
This hand holds a **heart** like a puppet, not a symbol of love but of its **illusion**. The heart dissolves, flowing into the underlying **fire of passion** which distinguishes the **sexual union** between man and woman, iconographically reported with the two symbols set in a ring: for Schopenhauer, in fact, the illusion of love caused by sole purpose of perpetuating life carried forward by the will to live, it always has a **sexual**, therefore material, background.
The fire and the man-woman union shown in the drawing affirm precisely this carnal basis on which the feeling of love is based.

The smoke and flames of the passionate fire fuel the **opening of an egg** in which a small stylized man is hidden and next to him we can glimpse **further eggs** just torn apart, about to hatch.
This is the purpose of love, or rather of the initial heart, that is, to ensure that beings reproduce to carry on life: here **the cycle closes** as indicated by the blue arrow above, indicating the heart.
The pessimistic **individual-nature relationship** therefore shines through, that is, unconsciously abandoning oneself to the illusions created by the genius of the species and wanting life at all costs.

Note that to stick to the decoration of a room, this whole part of thought is enclosed in a **picture** hanging on the brown wall.

## The struggle of all things

The painting above that of love is a **globe** covered by the iconic position of two **crossed swords**: in order to keep themselves alive (and therefore satisfy the will to live shattered into multiple beings), the individuals of the natural world are hostile to each other, thus leading to a **universal struggle** (crossed swords over the world).

However, taking a step back in reading the drawing and returning to the level of the animals in the cosmic pyramid, we can notice that the aforementioned image of the **gazelle** presents the animal with an "X"-shaped eye, i.e. to say dead: according to the concept of the struggle of all things, Schopenhauer states that every carnivorous animal is **sepulchre of countless herbivorous animals** and in fact the dead gazelle is closed inside the darker shape of an undefined **predator**.

## The destruction of various forms of optimism

As anti-idealistic pessimism, Schopenhauer's thought points its critical crosshairs towards the various **forms of optimism**, typical of contemporary and previous philosophies: by virtue of this the philosopher is counted as one of the greatest "* *masters of suspicion**”.
The optimisms criticized by Schopenhauer are three and they are detached from the rest of his thoughts, reported on the wall of the room (this is the destructive, not constructive, component). In fact, the three criticisms are shown on the **wooden floor**: cosmic optimism, historical optimism and social optimism.

• The **broken cross** represents the criticism of **universal optimism**, that is, placing faith in the existence of a good and rational God, creator of the world.
Schopenhauerian atheism is based on the very consideration of the world as **illogical**, painful and the struggle of all things; a god cannot therefore exist, especially if he is a benevolent entity and producer of logic.
The beliefs of theistic philosophies are shattered in the philosophical system of the thinker and with them also that symbolic Latin cross, evocation of belief in God.

• **Historical optimism** is figured by the **burning book**; more precisely it is a history book.
This last doctrine for Schopenhauer does not have great cognitive significance, since historians do not undertake to reveal the **basic structures** that distinguish historical becoming but are only concerned with analyzing in detail the individual events, which under the appearance they have **nothing new**.
Consequently, the writing _“history”_ **is repeated** identically on the cover of the book and studying separately what is based in depth on the same dialectical structures is useless: the book written by a historian is therefore burning, completely devalued by philosophy of the Polish thinker.

• The **protruding knife** on the edge of the room contains the criticism of **social optimism**: man does not live in community with others for pure good, but for **utility**.
So much so that mutual hostility between men remains constant and the State serves to guarantee protection from the aggressive instincts of men against their peers.
This explains the **heart that vainly tries to hide the blade of the knife**: human aggression cannot be contained in a refutable social optimism that professes benevolence among men, as it is a fundamental component of the manifestations of the same will to live.

## The pendulum of life: between pain and boredom

One of the most significant metaphors used by Schopenhauer is that of the **pendulum** to explain human life: it is characterized, as we have already said, by the maximum objectification of the will and if wanting means desiring and perceiving shortcomings, then the necessary sentimental manifestation of he noumenal essence of the world is pain.

The motion of the pendulum drawn on the sheet is animated by the **black ink** of the will and at the ends of its frame there are two different faces, on the right **sad** and on the left **loose** without fully defined expression.
The pendulum swings from the face of ** pain ** to that of ** boredom **, fleetingly passing through that of ** pleasure ** placed in the middle: this is precisely the motion explained by Schopenhauer of his pendulum.
The break from pain is pleasure, which is only a fleeting illusion (it is not good, but only a break from evil) which will dissolve in boredom, the vanishing of desire. By virtue of this, the face on the left is a pleasant expression that is melting, representing the **dissolution of will**.

In order to further explain this concept, the illustration is based on a personal figurative interpretation: the **tank system**, in which the expressive faces reveal themselves to be **water containers**, connected with pipes.
The redundant motion of the pendulum causes the water to transfer from pain to pleasure and once the latter is full, we reach boredom, from whose facial cavities the water comes out; it is a further reference to the dissolution of desire.

## Escapes from drawing

The most congenial part of the design is certainly the one inherent to the "**ways of liberation**", that is, the actual methodologies explained by Schopenhauer in order to **escape from the pain** that characterizes human life.
This is possible thanks to the existential experience, the cause of a so-called passage from **voluntas** to **noluntas**, i.e. a rejection of life as well as the will to live.
For this reason the cavities in the drawing are the paths of liberation, colored with **bright shades** and where the black ink of the will does not reach. The **openings** arise from the need to make the best possible visual escapes from Schopenhauer's painful system of existence, that is, from drawing.
It is therefore not a question of "committing suicide", but of lifting one's self from the chain of pains that disturb human existence.
Interpreting the illustrations from bottom to top, the three paths of liberation are **art**, the **ethics of piety** and **asceticism**.

• The first path of liberation is symbolized by a **coloured painting**, the canvas of which is **torn** regularly and gives life to a sort of **door**: it is about liberation through art, which is a doctrine that deals with **ideas** and not the concrete phenomenon. The spectator who therefore observes the work of art becomes the **pure eye** of the world which contemplates the eternal idea presented on the canvas through artistic representation.
Around the frame of the painting, the drawing depicts a brush and spatula covered in paint that operate directly on the painting; below, however, you can see the presence of a stylized **black eye**, that is, the **pure eye** of the world that observes art.
Above the frame, the writing "art" reiterates the first path to liberation which is a temporary and not fully effective spell (as soon as you stop observing the work of art you return to painful reality); apparently it is in fact the cavity which, although completely open, appears to be the **most closed**.

• The second path of liberation is the ethics of pity, as well as the only love admitted as benevolent in the Schopenhauerian universe as **disinterested**.
Founded on the concept of "compassion", it is the path of **authentic knowledge**, that is to say experimentation with the **metaphysical unity** of all beings, where the individual who sympathizes feels within himself the pain of others. Here at the basis of the relationship between tormentor and tormented, under the illusion of the wickedness committed by one and the victimization suffered by the other, there is a feeling of remorse and compassion for the one who torments and who therefore becomes emotionally close to the tormented.
The **golden oval** that encloses the bipartite panel ends at the top with **clasped hands** (compassion), while the fracture seems to separate the **good blue** (tormented) part from the **evil red** (tormentor) part but it is only appearance, as they both make up the oval box.
Attached to the edge of the box there is a label with the word "pity" while on the sides there are the words "charity" (do good) and "justice" (do no harm).
It should be noted that the ethics of pity is more effective liberation and the fracture is immediately **more open**.

• The last path to liberation, as well as the definitive one to defeat the will to live, is asceticism, that is, the **eradication of one's desire to exist**.
It means leading a life in **self-maceration**, sacrifice, fasting, poverty and humility, reported on the torn sheet at the far left of the "ascetic" shelf.
It does not end with ecstasy but with **Buddhist nirvana**, as evidenced by the golden statuette above the shelf (Schopenhauer's oriental influences); it is nothingness, or rather **denial of our world** (which has therefore been definitively devalued), a shining universe of infinite well-being, a different world, brightly colored green and blue, surrounded by a flaming mystical trail that enhances the spiritual and detached character.
This is the path of ultimate liberation and the opening is **completely torn** into the world of Buddhist nirvana; the concept of total liberation is also taken up by the **open padlock** hanging on the far right of the shelf.
