# <span className='kierkegaard'>KIERKEGAARD:</span> AN ANGUISHED EXISTENCE

**Soren Aabye Kierkegaard** is recognized by tradition as one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century, whose thought is a clear contrast to Hegelian idealism: Kierkegaard in fact can be traced back together with Schopenhauer, to one of those radical **criticisms to Hegel's thought**.
Furthermore, the Danish philosopher is considered the first thinker in history to talk about "human existence" and therefore considered the precursor of **Existentialism** (philosophical current of the 20th century).
The design inherent to his thought takes shape through a completely original approach: it is a real "**mobile**", whose shape favors a system of drawers created to enhance the concept of "possibility" (which we will see later).
The drawing should be read by first observing the yellow part on the left, almost outside the cabinet and above the philosopher's head; then starting from the bottom we continue upwards for the furniture installation.
Finally, the **portrait of the philosopher** is located in profile on the right, as if the thinker was observing his own thoughts and favoring his contemplative attitude.

## The instance of the individual and the battle against Hegel

**Anti-Hegelianism** is an integral component of Kierkegaard's thought and as such finds its place within the design.
In contrast to Hegelian Reason, the existentialist philosopher formulates _“the instance of the individual”_ (shown at the top, as the title of the illustrations below).

In this perspective Kierkegaard supports the **existent as such** and accuses Hegel of all his "philosophical errors" committed: the illustration presents precisely all the wrong considerations of Hegelian idealism filtered through the vision of the Danish thinker.
To accentuate the "defeat of Hegel in the Kierkegaardian system", just under the sign of the individual's instance, there is a painting depicting the **face of Hegel in the act of melting**: ideologically it is precisely his philosophy that is disintegrating before Kierkegaard's thought.

## The criticism of Hegelianism

Going from top to bottom we encounter different and symbolic representations: first of all a painting with **two white cartoons** without writing, placed in the top left corner.
The error exalted by this representation is the "**thought that thinks itself**", i.e. a thought devoid of a concrete subject, i.e. the individual, claimed by Kierkegaard under the name of "single": Hegel in fact carries out a It is total abstraction and even the thinking subject is mistakenly absorbed into that same thought.

Kierkegaard profoundly criticizes this vision and states that the individual must be not only concrete (and not abstract) but considerable as existing as such: in short, Hegel's huge mistake is to transform the human race into an **animal race** so that the human race surpasses the single individual in the idealistic vision of the German philosopher.
This argument is acceptable only in the animal domain but not in the case of man, where the individual (superior to the genus) exists and lives existence: in the drawing three particular characters (in some ways strange) near the philosopher's hat, they maintain the disturbing appearance of **half-men and half-animals** (fish, cat and bird), as if they were in the process of a radical transformation, the one carried out ideologically by Hegel (gender above the individual) and accused by Kierkegaard (single above the genre).
Hegel's error is thus translated into the appearance of these mysterious and dreamlike beings, whose half-bird man seems to look out and indicate the part of furniture on which a globe rests: according to Kierkegaard this error must be corrected with the consideration of the individual who lives the problematicity and the risk of existence in the world and his existence in it is **unrepeatable**.

Above the painting with Hegel's face, there is the image of God with his face covered, but recognizable thanks to the thick beard, the white and red robe and the iconic position of the arms (Latin cross): this is the error Hegelian way of identifying man and God, that is, the **finite as a manifestation of the infinite**.
In reality, Kierkegaard states, there is an infinite qualitative difference between man and God and therefore Hegel's mistake is to glue one onto the other, the image of **man onto that of God** (i.e. considering the finite as a manifestation of the infinite), as happens in the drawing: a flesh-colored shape overlooks the shape of God.
The **eye** in the center of the man's head makes up for the lack of the face of God, as if that eye and that of God are the same thing; it is a matter of further reiterating Hegel's identification error (in fact we will see that the finite individual lives in the domain of non-truth).

To conclude therefore, the single individual in Hegel dissolves, or rather **shatters** in Hegelian Reason and to totalize what we have said a **woody silhouette of a man seems to collapse into pieces** downwards: the single individual, in Hegel's domain , is annihilated in pieces that fall hastily, while the head remains hanging at the starting point of Kierkegaard's philosophy; the **instance of the individual**.

## Anguish as the pure feeling of possibility

After having clarified and corrected the misunderstandings of Hegel's philosophy, Kierkegaard comes to the consideration of life / existence as the **becoming uncertain** and problematic of the individual expressed in the title of his most famous work "**Either/Or**”. In short, existence revolves around the category of "**possibility**" and the feeling of it is **anguish**.

In order to talk about this, the philosopher relies on **Adam** in order to explain the relationship that exists between anguish and possibility: when Adam committed the **original sin**, he came into contact with his own possibility of power, thus overcoming not only innocence, but also ignorance of what can happen.
It is no coincidence that the protagonist of the part underneath the piece of furniture is an enormous **marble bust**, at the base of which we see the writing _“Adamo”_.
Although his **facial expression** can be considered marginal, in reality it tries to express in the most exhaustive way the feeling of possibility: anguish.
Kierkegaard states that this is the feeling of **nothing**, that is, linked to nothing, only to the concept of the possibility that something is, but which now is not (unlike all other states of mind, we know from what are concretely caused and what they refer to, but not anguish).

Here the distressing possibility of power is visualized in its negative perspective as a threat of nothingness and for this reason summarized in the figure of marble Adam: he has already committed his sin as evidenced by the **bitten apple** on the pedestal and the threat of this possible (or rather than this nothing) is expressed by the **tempting snake** that wraps around his neck, that is, attraction to that unpleasant possible alternative.
To further refer to the setting of **Eden**, behind Adam an **elementary landscape** with blue sky, white clouds and green ground creates the atmosphere described by the Christian tradition.

## The distressing hourglasses of the future

In order to better understand the **possibility-anguish** relationship, we should understand the **possibility-future** relationship: Adam's sin becomes the cause of anguish and knowledge of the possibility of power since it can actually happen in the future and therefore does not live exclusively in the past.

With the passage of time (i.e. the future) what threatens us in the present can occur as he is not locked up in a simple and past past: the **hourglasses** symbolically express precisely this. The anguish on Adam's face seems to be caused precisely by the fact that he himself is holding two large hourglasses, which rather than a physical effort express a **sentimental effort** (they are not weights to be lifted with the body but torments to be endured with the soul).
In fact, remembering that they cause anguish, we can understand why they each contain an **apple**: the possible, with the passing of time embodied in the **sand**, can happen again and that possible is original sin, which figuratively is the bitten apple.
Adam, however, holds two and they are two different possible alternatives, or rather they host two different alternatives: an **intact apple** (right) and a **bitten apple** (left), that is, a possibility that the sin **is not** and possibility that sin **is**.
Consequently, it is as if the two hourglasses not only embody the future but also the temporal possibility that Adam himself faces.

As a good pessimist, Kierkegaard states with certainty that every favorable possibility (regardless of the situation) is annihilated by the **infinite number of unfavorable possibilities**.
Precisely for this reason, the temporal possibility on the right (the favorable one) takes shape by means of an hourglass **shattered** at the bottom and from which the sand comes out, pouring onto the underlying apples present in an indefinite number around the statue of Adam as if the time, that is, the sand, was dispersed among the unfavorable possibilities of sin, that is, the **bitten apples**.
The same serpent wrapped around Adam's neck looks towards the countless sins of which he is the attractor.

## Living and talking about anguish

Adam raises a **boulder** on his head with the writing _“anguish”_ which acts as a pillar for the entire furniture complex together with the hourglasses (another reference to the anguish revealed in the connection between the possible and the future) : as Kierkegaard specifies in his writings “**The concept of anguish**”, anguish is the most painful and at the same time the most **necessary human category** and therefore figuratively it is the pillar of existence as well as of Kierkegaard's philosophy (therefore of everything mobile).

After all, the Danish thinker was nicknamed the "**prophet of anguish**" both for how he talks about it and for how he experiences it.
In fact, let us remember that Kierkegaard experienced the pain of a famous "**splinter in the flesh**" closely linked to possibility and probably to permanent indecision, to the disharmonious balance between the opposing alternatives of the possibility itself: this painful balance is defined by the philosopher “**zero point**”, i.e. the impossibility of completely unbalancing oneself by favoring a certain task in one's life.
The zero point takes is depicted in the "o" of anguish, replaced with a red colored **zero** that looms large in the center of the word but not only; the **balance** maintained by Adam to support the stony block on his head also refers to this eternal balance suffered by men and by Kierkegaard himself.

For the philosopher, the only way to salvation is **religion**, or rather the Christian faith, as evidenced by the depiction in the background of an **anchor next to** the **Bible** and the **Latin cross**.
“**The lifeline**” is connected at the top to the noticeboard at the top of the cabinet, that of religion and faith, an isolated and separate environment as we will see; while the Bible and the Latin cross refer to the **Christian cult**, to which the philosopher is linked and which he talks about in depth.

To conclude, the philosopher's gaze is turned towards the fulcrum of his philosophy: anguish, revealed in the relationship with the possible and the future (Adam, apples and hourglasses).

## The drawer system

Continuing to read the illustration upwards, we encounter the suggestive **drawer system** mentioned previously: more specifically, these are two different drawers that enhance the concept of possibility in two different areas, that is, the relationship between **man and the world** and the relationship between **man and his interiority**.

The possibility provides two alternatives each time, in which one **excludes** the other and for this reason, moving the paper card that makes up the drawer system reveals one part and hides another.
As we said, the two drawers concern and symbolize the possibilities of two different areas well analyzed by Kierkegaard and it is therefore that from now on we will proceed in parallel in order to understand the illustration: the piece of furniture is divided approximately in half, separating the relationship with the 'interiority (on the left) from the relationship with the world (on the right).

A misunderstanding of the design is that very often the drawer system is to the detriment of what is hidden under the protruding tiles: in short, by lowering both drawers downwards, we will be revealed what is drawn above but most of it is hidden. of the illustration of Adam.
This is a space problem linked to the illustration, even though the drawer system seems to be perfect and extremely congenial for the concept of possibility it expresses.

## The risk of choice

When Kierkegaard speaks of the unrepeatable existence of the individual, he focuses with particular attention on the same problematic nature that distinguishes it: man as an existent lives without preconceived certainties and for this reason the choice in the face of possibility (in whatever field it may be) is dangerously risky. .

On the wooden pole that separates the two areas of existence in the piece of furniture, we have nailed a **face with an anguished expression**, an expression of man's problematic nature; on it the writing _“choice”_ indicates with clear precision what we have just referred to and the fact that it belongs to both the two parts of existence.
The choice takes place both in the sphere of interiority (left) and in that of exteriority (right), because in both there is a possibility and therefore an anguished feeling: the face, in addition to expressing this, embodies **risk** same as choosing one or the other alternative.

## Do I want or don't I want myself?

Let's start from the left and enter the domain of interiority, clarified in the writing "**The deadly disease**".
In this context the subject considered is the **I**, understood by Kierkegaard as a relationship that relates to itself and as such sees before it the possibility of achieving two alternatives: wanting to be oneself and not wanting to be oneself; these alternatives are represented with the first drawer mechanism.

• We pull the card downwards (as if it were opened from below) and observe the pink box: the ego **does not want itself** and as such reaches "despair", since rejecting oneself means rejecting a relationship that it is constitutive to him by nature. The **reddish color** accentuates the “no” from the ego to itself, fully expressed by the red **“_<span className='marx'>X</span>_”** placed at the top right and furthermore _“the ego”_ seems to be **shattered** as it self-rejects.
The dramatic note is given by the crying little white man; it is the individual who has fallen into "**despair**" as a participant in an impossible internal rejection.

• Now we push the card up, as if to close the drawer: the alternative that excludes the other and was previously excluded will automatically be revealed above: **wanting oneself**.
The box is **green** and the "**V**" indicates that in this case the ego wants itself as such: _"the ego"_ is **intact** and no longer shattered into a dramatic refusal, yet this time too the singular little white man bows his head, desperate and **crying** for what he is experiencing in his interiority.
Kierkegaard maintains that wanting oneself means never reaching balance/rest because one considers oneself **finished**, therefore insufficient for oneself. Even in this case we reach "**despair**".

## Despair…

We therefore note that in both cases we arrive at what Kierkegaard calls "**mortal disease**": _"despair"_, reported in the upper part of the mobile block we are analyzing.
It is therefore a question of experiencing the death of the ego, which does not mean suicide or physical death but the impossible denial of the possibility of the ego, since both alternatives lead to the same unfavorable conclusion.

In fact, the death of the ego, since it is present in both alternatives reported, takes place exactly in the middle of them, above the part of the sheet under which the drawer card slides.
We note the tragic depiction of a **tombstone** in front of which a rectangular **pit** opens up, or the **tomb** of the self, as witnessed on the funeral stone.
The **black Latin cross** under the writing "I" refers to death and the connection with the Christian tradition to which Kierkegaard was devoted.

Note that the tomb is open, as if to show who is tragically in that grave: desperation in fact consists in **participating** in the death of the ego and internally observing this same mortal illness. The **red background** populated by lightning accentuates the tragic nature of the scene, which has been summarized in a small **picture** hanging on the wooden wall of the furniture, as if adapting to a furnishing object.

## …and his birth

As a synthesis of **necessity** and **freedom**, the ego experiences desperation due to the lack of these two components: in order to see the illustration inherent to this, it is necessary to lower the left drawer and observe the two **white characters** set in the compartments of the furniture, under the writing _“despair”_.
• The lack of freedom is embodied in the white man on the left, whose face is composed of a **lock** and a sad expression: the character is tied to strings, as if suffering from his condition of **cause**. In fact, Kierkegaard maintains that to avoid despair one must find a possibility, which becomes in a certain sense vital.
That man must find possibilities that **free him internally**, that is, a key that opens himself (lock on his face) to a better condition, freedom.

• The lack of necessity is instead on the right, embodied in a mysterious **doubtful** character, as if lost in the very possibilities: Kierkegaard states that to despair means taking refuge in possibilities that **multiply themselves**, that is, fantastic and impossible possibilities in Anyway.
The unlimited possibilities swallow up the ego, losing it in the lack of necessity since it is as if everything becomes possible (there is no longer any necessity).
The bewilderment is expressed in the doubtful air of the white man and the infinite possibilities materialize in the **question marks** around, which have now also invaded the **face** of that same man.

All the characters depicted in this part of the drawing are white in color as they embody the ego, not man in the carnal sense of concreteness.
Let's therefore say that the little white man is the usual character, that is, the "I" faced with different situations.

## Aesthetics or ethics?

Moving on to the other half of the cabinet, we begin to talk about the relationship between man and the world resolved in the famous theory of **stages of existence**: in this context, the dominant feeling is anguish and no longer desperation; furthermore, to demonstrate the relationship with the world, there is a **world map** that adapts to the furniture decor.
The drawer system exhaustively summarizes the theory of the stages of existence: for Kierkegaard there are two types of lives that can be lived in which one excludes the other as there is a leap between them. These alternatives of a possibility are called “aesthetic life” and “ethical life”.

• **aesthetic life** is represented by drawing on the lower part of the drawer, the one that is revealed to us if the card is moved downwards.
In fact, aesthetic life takes shape through the figure of **Don Giovanni** who relies on continually changing women: the esthete is the one who, according to Kierkegaard, is continuously **searching for the new**, the unusual and the different and which does not tolerate repetition, the everyday and the common.
For this reason it is a **choice not to choose** that leads to despondency: Don Giovanni realizes that in that continuous surrounding himself with lovers he does not find the right woman, the definitive choice that leads him to happiness.
In fact, for Kierkegaard this is the lowest stage of life and as such the statuette of Don Giovanni locked in the drawer is **bronze** and so is the background. Don Giovanni is embracing two **female figures** to summarize what we have just said and the words _“aesthetics”_ appear on his pedestal.
Looking carefully, just to the right of the bronze statuette, outside the piece of furniture, there is a **book** inserted in a compartment of the piece of furniture: the cover bears the title "**Diary of a Seducer**" in which the philosopher expresses the concept of aesthetic life and ethical life through the protagonist of the novel, Johannes, who is committed to seeking the most satisfying pleasures (ethics).

• Let's now push the tile upwards: we observe the **silver statuette** regarding **ethical life**.
By virtue of the discouragement faced with a choice not to choose, that leap towards ethical life is made which, in contrast with Don Giovanni, is summarized in the metaphor of the **husband in marriage**.
The latter chooses the woman he loves and this choice is a true **absolute choice**, that is, a choice that is reconfirmed day by day as it is the bride who leads to that lasting and absent happiness in the search for the "different" of Don Giovanni.
The spouses stand on a pedestal with the writing _“ethics”_.

## The knife of sin

By lowering the card of ethical life, you will see a **bloody knife**: this is the iconography of **sin** that every man reaches with his own awareness.
Kierkegaard focuses on how the man who makes the absolute (ethical) choice identifies himself in his own history and as such also recognizes its mistakes and sins. This is the last step of ethical life, since man, realizing that he lives in the domain of **non-truth**, relies on the religious life represented in the glass board together with all the "religious domain".

Note that the face halfway between the two parts of the furniture also expresses the **discomfort** in front of that bloody knife, since the position of the pupils suggests that it is looking at it and fearing it in a certain sense.
Finally, the knife hangs from the noticeboard above thanks to a **rope** that comes from an **eye-shaped cavity**, contained behind the glass above: it is as if the transition to religious life occurs by following that same rope from which hangs the knife and occurs only if **I see** (eye) my sin in my story and identify with it.

## The leap towards religious life

Let's go up towards that **isolated** and preserved environment behind the **display case** on top of the piece of furniture: to reach the so-called **religious life**, Kierkegaard talks about making a real **leap**, or I jump.

First of all let's observe the **golden religious statuette**: it embodies religious life, understood as ultimate salvation and as such golden. The two characters represented are **Abraham and Isaac**, protagonists of Christian culture and of the episode according to which the father (Abraham) must kill his son (Isaac) by divine order; for obvious reasons the bearded character on the left, i.e. Abraham, is raising the **sword** as a sign of threat towards the character bent over on the right, i.e. Isaac.
With this Kierkegaard speaks of religious life as a paradox and scandal for various reasons, but certainly the most important one is the total "suspension of morality".

## The scandalous call of faith

The paradox of faith and Christianity is the **suspension of morality**, that is to say the suspension of all moral principles in order to pursue the **religious verb**: and here we understand the role of Abraham who wants to sacrifice immorally Isaac by order of God.

This scandal is enhanced by the illustration hanging from above, to the left of the golden statuette: it is a **medallion** of the Latin cross which has a **crack** in the middle, as if to iconographically recall that same paradox.
On the other hand, just under the medallion a **hand holding a red heart** appears: this is the moral, which in order to be seen correctly requires a 180° reversal of the sheet, that is, a reversal of the religious dominion allowed found on the bulletin board as the divine command seems to be the opposite of the moral verb (in the story of Abraham and Isaac).

Furthermore, the _"moral"_ writing at the crown of the red heart appears to be **illegible**: at first glance, the writing seems to have been created to be read upside down but if the child is turned over one realizes that it is once again impossible to read as it is written from right to left.
In conclusion, the **scandal of faith** is that in its domain morality is suspended, incomprehensible and illegible and the writing just explained translates precisely this in a technical way.

## The bubble of an absolute relationship with the absolute

Let's move to the right and observe an even more isolated environment than anything we have seen so far: a real **bubble** in which two white characters take their places; it's about **faith** for Kierkegaard.

The Danish thinker believes that faith is not a general concept but an **absolute relationship with the absolute**, that is, a **private** relationship that connects man lived in non-truth, with the absolute, that is God (the truth).
It is no coincidence that faith is the opposite of sin and as such it is what is achieved by becoming aware of "that knife" that is one's own.
The two characters are represented **colorless** since the relationship with God is outside of space and time, as well as isolated in singularity (impossible to think that it happens in company) and therefore in that strange white bubble.
The **faithful** is the self who turns to **God** and therefore, as we have said, is also depicted as white like the previous cases; the figure above the pedestal of _“faith”_ is God and a rope is tied to his outstretched arm, tied below the anchor mentioned at the beginning, since that absolute relationship called faith is the only anchor of salvation in human existence .

Finally, the **question mark** indicates that morality can be suspended by virtue of that intimate relationship with God only if one is even hit by the **doubt** of having to suspend it and having to achieve the divine word.
Consequently, for Kierkegaard, the certainty of taking the path of faith arises from the uncertainty of suspending moral norms: faith is therefore **anguished certainty**.

## The eternal in the sands of time

There is one last element missing to specify and it is the **hourglass** placed at the far right of the glass board: it embodies the concept of **eternity in time**, or the moment in which the isolated relationship is experienced with God.
The hourglass embodies the **passing of time**, which is therefore the sand itself but if you look carefully at the illustration you can see the **red infinity symbol** in the middle of the hourglass.
In this case it is an infinite combined with time and as such eternal: it must be kept in mind that Kierkegaard considers man and God separate, where the first is sin and non-truth while the second is truth and the search for him has not led to ' man for any purpose.

The concept of the eternal in finite time lies in Kierkegaard's consideration of Christianity as a **historical fact**, so that it has no privileged witnesses and its historicity occurs every time man experiences the moment of absolute relationship, that is faith.
This explains the eternal red symbol that is part of the passage of time, of history.
