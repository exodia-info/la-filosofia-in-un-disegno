# <span className='bergson'>BERGSON</span>: SPIRITUALISM AND VITALISM

After the growing trust in man, in technology and in science, there was a period of "**change of direction**" which led different intellectuals to rely on new methods of knowledge that contrasted with the positivist philosophical current: thus the **antipositivist** currents of which **Spiritualism** becomes part, a philosophical current that favors "consciousness" as an instrument of thought and knowledge.

The drawing is rigorously set and the theme covered is the thought of the French philosopher **Henri Bergson**, as well as the founder of Spiritualism itself.
The protagonist of the illustration is the portrait of the philosopher and his philosophical system is rendered by means of concepts symbolized and reduced to specific representations, exactly as in the other illustrations.

## The distinction between the outside and the inside

The illustration enhances the distinction between what is found inside **inside** Bergson's body and what is found outside** and therefore also that new attitude where the instrument of knowledge is no longer external to man, but internal to it.
In the first case, in fact, everything that refers to life, to the **spirit** and to the inner dimension is highlighted and outlined, in which conscience is not only sovereign but is also an instrument of true knowledge in the spiritualist doctrine; while in the second case everything that is linked to nature, to **science** and to the external dimension is outlined, that is, everything that is promptly devalued in this period.

The background is created with a combination of bands of **celestial shades** animated in a swirl around the shape of a clock: a truly spiritual background, which leaves much more space for the artistic-aesthetic component of the design, rather than to the conceptual one.

## Time as a construct of consciousness

The clock with the white dial placed behind Bergson's head represents **the psychological consideration of time**: the latter is in fact considered as a product of consciousness, without which it would therefore not exist.

In "**Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness**" the philosopher proposes the image of the dial of a generic clock and focuses on how in reality, in the moment in which one observes it, one perceives only the single position of the hand in that moment. instant, i.e. the one depicted on the drawing.
The movement of the latter and therefore the perception of the passage of time, as well as time itself, is given to our mind thanks to the use of consciousness, which perceives that the hand was and will be found geometrically in different positions.
Hence the meaning of the **large dial** with the hand, which if in fact is **backlit**, in correspondence with the word "**consciousness**", will reveal the **previous and subsequent positions** of the hand black (i.e. its movement) drawn on the back of the sheet.

The word consciousness is characterized not only by the fact that if illuminated it reveals the flow of time and its role in it, but it is also in correspondence with the **hidden pivot of the hands**, as if to symbolize that it plays a focal role in the perception of their motorcycle.
It should be noted that the clock is placed at the center of the composition and as a background behind Bergson's head as it constitutes a fundamental concept underlying his thought, for which he also became particularly famous.

## The clock of life and science

The two further representations of clocks refer to the distinction between "**time of life**" and "**time of science**", particularly important in Bergsonian philosophy.

• The time of life materializes in the clock with the **red heart** pulsating in Bergson's chest in the centre: it is inside the philosopher's body and colored with **golden tones** as the French thinker enhances its intimate connection with life.
Due to its characteristics, life time can be defined as "**total creation and conservation**", assimilated in the metaphor of the **ball of wool** iconographically represented hanging from the clock hand; in fact, Bergson specifies, every moment that we live is the result of a total creation of all the previous moments and at the same time it is also their total conservation, since the lived past always follows us entirely.
For this reason the French philosopher speaks of _"duration"_, rendered with a bright **green sign** under the golden clock while above the dial is connected to Bergson's head, or rather to the word _"consciousness"_, notion -pillar of his spiritualist theories.

• Behind the neck and the right shoulder, stands the science time dial in which the numbers are conceptually replaced by **scientific symbols** used in every branch of studies.
Due to its characteristics, the time of the science can be compared to a **pearl necklace**, hanging from the hand.
According to Bergson, in fact, scientific time is made up of **repeatable** moments (the experiment can be repeated), of moments **independent** of each other (different and detached experiments) and of measurable moments **only quantitatively** and not also qualitatively (like that of life).
It is therefore an **abstract and spatialized** time and to accentuate this the image of a **chronometer** that measures it has been added (since here time takes shape for the clock).

## Feelings determine and constitute the soul

In “**Matter and Memory**” Bergson expresses the link between body and spirit by specifying in advance how the **soul is free**.

In this preface the philosopher outlines how the spirit is **constituted** from moment to moment by different **feelings** and that at the same time these feelings **even determine** it: consequently if what constitutes it is also what which determines it, the soul determines itself and lives in a condition of freedom. Iconographically this concept is rendered by an illustration inside Bergson's body (in fact it must not be traced back to external causes) in which a series of **ghostly faces**, symbolizing the spirit, flow like a river in flood inside of the lock of an **open padlock**.
The flaming flow of those different emotions rendered with **colors and various expressions** moves impetuously opening the **padlock**, thus making the soul free.
A red ribbon tied to the open padlock suggests how it too is linked to man's inner faculty: conscience, a tool for learning the freedom of the soul and all its characteristics.

## Consciousness = memory

One of the fundamental elements specified by Bergson in the relationship between body and soul is "**memory**", considered as a sort of **automatic recorder** of everything we experience and as a **total conservator** of our past complete, including what we have completely forgotten.
Paradoxically, memory coincides with the notion of **consciousness** even though it is made up more of "oblivion" than "consciousness", as Bergson specifies (in fact it is not memory as we understand it today).
However, the place in which memory ideologically resides is the mind and this is why the luminous sign of _"consciousness"_ is placed in the **skull** of the philosopher, whose cavity reveals the ultimate faculty of man.
Below the red writing there is a sort of artery connected to the concept of "human life" and which ideologically would also be connected to the other illustrations already narrated.

## Eye = memory

For Bergson, **memory** is the materialization in the present of a datum of consciousness, or rather of memory and therefore dating back to the past.
The blue and luminous sign of the _"memory"_ is placed in correspondence with the **eye** of the philosopher according to a purely personal interpretation.
The eye is in fact the instrument to be able to see but in this case it is not an "external seeing" but an "**inner seeing**", which is why the only eye present is **closed**, as if observing what is inside and to select the memory data to recover; it is precisely the "**perception**".
Returning to the concept of "memory", if it is the materialization of a past event then ideologically "remembering" means **visualizing here and now** an image of the past and therefore using that eye turned to the inner dimension (perception) in function of a present need.
That's why the "memory" is behind the shattered socket of the left eye.

## The life of man and the life of nature

The failure to overcome the dualism between body and soul will characterize the distinction between human life and natural life in the writing "**Creative Evolution**".
In Bergson's left shoulder the clear division between the **life of nature** (emerging from his body) and the **life of man** (contained entirely in his body) is systematically depicted, originating from the famous "Momentum Vital” which we will talk about later.

• The **red branch** is entirely contained in the body of the philosopher and hosts the sign _“man”_ at the beginning of the division.
It highlights how the life of the latter develops along a **single path** and the existence of each of us implies choices that favor one path while completely canceling others.
In short, that thick single artery highlights the uniqueness of human life and how all alternative paths to the one represented are nipped in the bud and therefore only hints of ramifications are present.
The artery connects directly to the "consciousness" in Bergson's body, understood as **man's faculty** and his living; moreover, it is the same color as him.

• The **bluish branching** begins with the writing _“nature”_ and continues outside the body of the thread with a vast multiplicity of **branches**: the life of nature in fact does not experience the limit of choice and for this reason it follows all the possible "**evolutionary roads**" even if some of them are **dead-end streets**, as Bergson himself specifies (this means those times when evolution stops at underdeveloped beings).
The philosopher also defines individual divisions in the natural world, depicted in the drawing in a simplified form.
The first division is just above the philosopher's shoulder and presents the distinction between **animals** and **vegetables**, the latter rendered with the iconography of a **rose and two leaves**.
While the vegetal branching continues behind Bergson's head, the animal one reveals a quadruple division: **molluscs**, represented with a **snail**; **echinoderms**, represented with a **sea urchin**; **arthropods**, represented with a **fly head**; **vertebrates**, represented with hanging **bones**.
Note that the first two ramifications end in a brutal break which highlights how they are those "dead ends" we talked about before.
Continuing the paths of arthropods and vertebrates, after an indistinct multiplicity of divisions we arrive at a **butterfly** surrounded by midges and a stylized **anthropomorphic figure** (a black silhouette).
In fact, the spiritualist philosopher exalts insects as the **culminating** form in the arthropod panorama and the human one in the vertebrate panorama.
To enhance their state of supremacy, both the butterfly and the human silhouette are surrounded by a white halo.

## Élan Vital

Human life and natural life are identified in the same principle of origin which mostly leads to defining nature as unique: it is the famous "**Vital Momentum**" or "Élan Vital", i.e. an **original impulse** which with its strength produced all the branches of the natural world (like a firework).
It can be identified as something internal and intrinsic in nature and therefore internal to Bergson's body.

The Vital Momentum is explained by Bergson with the metaphor of the **hand in the iron filings**, as depicted in the drawing.
The Élan Vital is the hand that, immersed among the grains of ferrous filings, causes the movement of the individual particles: these are nothing other than the **beings of the natural world** as the **magnifying glass** in front of the container wants to testify and showing the figure of an **animal** and a **tree** in the oculus.
Bergson imagines that that hand becomes invisible since the Vital Momentum is the law and the impulse from which natural evolution originates but not visible in the scientific field and in the supposed "laws of nature"; It is precisely with these statements that Bergson criticizes not only positivist thought with its trust in science and its methods but also more specifically the finalists and mechanists (such as **Charles Darwin**). Despite this, the hand is depicted "visible" to make its presence and concept more evident in the drawing, which is why, among other things, the container is **vitreous** and bears the acronym "**Fe**" of the iron indicate the material contained.
Finally, above the hand and therefore the Élan Vital, the two lives analyzed previously are articulated.

## Intelligence and instinct

Although the illustration in the drawing appears to be complete, in reality two further concepts need to be specified: those of **intelligence** and **instinct**.
Intelligence is the ability to **produce useful tools** and is typical of "Homo Sapiens", now definable as "**Homo Faber**": not so much wise, but more of a producer.
Intelligence therefore produces tools to understand and analyze nature (i.e. formulate laws) by visualizing it scientifically: hence the representation on the right of Bergson's head of a stylized **black eye** whose pupil projects a **luminous ray** mystery that affects "science time" and science itself.
This is the illustration of intelligence, whose luminous signal is populated by white **scientific signs** that help us visualize scientific practice.
Finally, above the eye, **two human arms** emerge bearing the writing _“Homo Faber”_, holding two pieces for the **construction of a hammer**: this iconography refers to the faculty of Homo Faber to produce or build useful tools, then back to intelligence.

Instinct, on the other hand, for Bergson is the ability to **use the tools** produced and, unlike intelligence, it is man's only spiritual means of being able to **understand his own interiority** and therefore the true meaning of life ; it is no coincidence that the illustration of him is internal to the body of the philosopher.
In this regard, the conscious return of intelligence (external analysis) to instinct (internal analysis) translates into **intuition**, an instinct that has become disintuitive.

• The **bluish branching** begins with the writing _“nature”_ and continues outside the body of the filos with a vast multiplicity of **branches**: the life of nature in fact does not experience the limit of choice and for this follows all the possible "**evolutionary roads**" even if some of them are **dead-end streets**, as Bergson himself specifies (this means those times in which evolution is blocked by underdeveloped beings).
The philosopher also defines individual divisions in the natural world, depicted in the drawing in a simplified form.
The first division is just above the philosopher's shoulder and presents the distinction between **animals** and **vegetables**, the latter rendered with the iconography of a **rose and two leaves**.

In this regard, the conscious return of intelligence (external analysis) to instinct (internal analysis) translates into **intuition**, an instinct that has become disinterested and self-aware depicted by the **telescope** held by an unknown **white character** (an ordinary man in his own inner dimension) in Bergson's right shoulder.
The character appears behind the flow of feelings but with the telescope he wants to analyze the entire mechanism inside the philosopher's body and this, after all, is the very purpose of intuition.
To conclude, the telescope lens bears the circular writing _"intuitio"_, a **Latin** term from which the word "intuition" lexically derives.
