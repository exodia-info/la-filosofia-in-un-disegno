# <span className='marx'>MARX</span>: THE FACE OF <span className='marx'>COMMUNISM</span>

Remembered as one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century, **Karl Marx** is counted as one of the main faces of **communist** ideology and thought, as the title suggests. Claimant of oppression by bourgeois society in the current capitalist system, Marx formulates a truly utopian socio-political model from which to draw an example.
In general we can say that the German philosopher became theorist par excellence of communist thought and was destined to influence generations contemporary and subsequent to him, as well as to be taken as an example in **practical** action by different revolutionaries and politicians (think for example to Lenin in Russia).

The drawing illustrates his thoughts from the ground up, characterized by a universal scope and containing a huge quantity of concepts: this would explain the fact that the sheet is populated by very dense illustrations which are also very varied but revolve around the same "**pivot of the ideal communist**”, embodied in the **face** of Marx.

The revolutionary vision of the philosopher is expressed in his own **pupil**, which is characterized by the **communist flag**: yellow hammer and sickle on a red background, the color of the rebellious soul.
This last detail also reflects how all Marxist thought is aimed at a **final solution** that fully improves modern political-social conditions: the advent of a mature communist society.

## The universal character of thought

Even before proceeding with the analysis of the illustration concerning the content of Marx's thought, some fundamental characteristics must be clarified and one of the main ones is without a doubt its **universal scope**.

Unlike other philosophers, Marx elaborates a thought that does not talk about economics, philosophy, history or the theory of state law but elaborates a thought that includes **all** of them: nothing is excluded and nothing is able to contain it .
This fundamental characteristic is illustrated in the portrait of Marx itself, around whose head symbolic objects rotate in **elliptical orbits**, detached from the rest of the drawing thanks to their thick contours. Ideologically, the thought of the depicted character (Marx) draws to itself all those areas symbolized by the illustrations, as if it were a **gravitational center** from which nothing escapes: we have an **hourglass** for **history**, a **gold coin** for the **economy**, a **written document** for the **philosophy of state law** and the **crown** with the inscription _“state”_ for **politics** and state government.

Note the arrangement on the two elliptical orbits present: on the one hand the crown and the parchment are on the same orbit as they are inherent to the "**theory of the State**", while the coin and the hourglass rotate on the same ellipse because the economic analysis of Marx will become the foundation of "**historical materialism**" (which we will see later).

## Outside the theoretical margins

Another characteristic already mentioned in some ways in the introduction concerns the **practical character** linked and exalted by Marxist thought: “Philosophers have only interpreted the world; it is now a question of changing it" writes Marx in the "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right".
This message is not only expressed by the philosopher's pupil which refers to a clear revolutionary intent but also by the fact that many times the illustrations dealing with his thoughts **exit the margins** of the squaring of the sheet and if one observes more carefully, proceeding towards the bottom even dominates the face of Marx himself: this figurative interpretation underlines that Marxist thought carries with it that intent to escape and go beyond theoretical limits, pouring itself into praxis. Remembering that the drawing deals with his thoughts from a **theoretical** point of view, highlighting that the illustrations go beyond the established graphic borders of the drawing itself means announcing an ambition to put the narrated ideals into **practice** and not an eternal experience in the container of theory.

## A rich and organized design

Marx's, as has already been said, is a very dense illustration, **rich in different figures** and symbols: in short, at first glance it seems to be too confusing to be explained, yet everything is organized in peculiar way.

In fact, Marx's drawing specifically analyzes every theme of his philosophizing without summarizing or leaving out any detail or even portraying it incorrectly.
Observing carefully, the dense chain of illustrations readable from top to bottom is systematically divided into **7 parts**, in which the third seems to be further divided into parts (and we will see why later). Consequently we have a general setting well **organized**, in which each part corresponds to a **work by Marx** and the analysis of the drawing proceeds precisely on these tracks, divided into his most important writings.

Another peculiarity of the illustration is the **colored background** that each part has: starting from a **faded flesh pink** (top) up to the **fiery red** (bottom) of the revolution, same shade as the communist flag imprinted on Marx's pupil; in fact, in the last writing we will participate in the advent of the long-awaited communist society.
In addition to enhancing this "**theoretical intensification**", the chromatic scale further enhances the **reading direction** of the drawing, i.e. in the shape of a mirrored "C", from top to bottom.
It may be difficult to identify this chromatic change in the drawing, since the borders that separate the illustrations relating to one work and another are not thick (as for example in Nietzsche's drawing) and are also often covered by the illustrations themselves: precisely the division has an **organizational function** in the design and analysis of Marxist thought, in which however there is continuity in the philosophical system and therefore the works cannot be narrated as separate, but connected to each other by **coherence of the message** that they bring with them (in fact several concepts that are much more linked to the themes of a work are actually introduced in other writings and this also makes the division approximate and non-fiscal).
The works (or parts) into which the drawing is divided and set out are: "**Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right**", "**Economic-philosophical Manuscripts**", "**Theses on Feuerbach** ”, “**The German Ideology**”, “**Manifesto of the Communist Party**”, “**Capital**” and “**Critique of the Gotha Program**”.

# Critique of Hegel's philosophy of right

This **philosophical-political** writing (due to the double scope that distinguishes it) is substantially characterized by the criticism of Hegel's "logical mysticism" and the criticism of modern civilization.
The paragraph analyzed is **light pink-flesh**.

## The philosophical error and political conservationism

Let's start by analyzing the philosophical-methodological scope of the writing and then observe the extreme upper left of the drawing, where half of **Hegel's face** can be glimpsed: his eye is the source of a **luminous ray** that hits one strange celestial character and a crown.

In fact, in the Hegelian vision, reality becomes a manifestation of the spirit and this error, specified under the Marxist definition of "**logical mysticism**", leads to thinking that these same realities are necessary. Translated into the socio-political sphere, Marx goes so far as to accuse the idealist philosopher of conservationism since the current institutions become **rational** and therefore necessary manifestations of a spiritual reality hidden behind them.
Consequently, Marx's thoughts regarding the criticism of Hegelian philosophy are summarized in the illustration of a light blue **spirit** (of which the head and arms are recognisable) which **dissolves** with the flow of the wind, giving life to a **crown**, personifying precisely those state institutions in force and in Marx's sights.
This sort of political justificationism, according to the communist philosopher, must be treated with the "**transformative**" method, that is, recognizing what is truly the subject.

## From heaven to earth

The historical-political scope of the work instead specifies a vision based on the fundamental **splitting between State and society**, solid ground for the construction of the criticism of the modern State: in particular Marx maintains that man, as a citizen, lives a double life. One is on earth and the other is in heaven; however this only happens in the dualism between "**State of heaven**" and "**society of earth**", in which the former, however, is only an illusion.

Society is an earthly or material, bourgeois and selfish environment, while the State is a celestial environment since it presents itself with the aim of pursuing a **common interest** (of all citizens), however Marx states that now, in modern liberal society this purpose has disappeared in a ruinous attraction of the State towards the land.
This dangerous **metaphorical fall** is expressed in the drawing by means of the writing _“state”_ which, linked to the _“o”_ of the writing _“society”_, falls from an overhead **cloud**, that is, the the celestial environment of good intentions completely obscured. The State's belonging to heaven is indicated by the **blue** color of the writing, as well as by the light blue **arrow** pointing downwards and symbolizing its fall; instead the earth of society is enhanced by the **brown** color of the writing and the **world map** that replaces the _“o”_ (and coincidentally to which the “lace of the fall” is tied).

## The pillars of modern society

Marx points the finger at a modern society **selfish**, linked only to material possessions in which good intentions of common interest have now been abandoned.
Observing the **cartoon** coming from the head of the bourgeois emerging from the second compartment, we note how it is divided into four parts and three of them constitutively describe the modern society criticized by Marx as counter-social.

In this iconography there are multiple meanings linked to the image of the bourgeois and the cartoon of him: the one inherent to the context discussed focuses on how the society summarized in that cartoon is properly "**bourgeois**", that is, material.
By analyzing what is depicted inside it we will be able to explain the **pillars** on which this social system so criticized by Marx is based: first of all it is an **atomized** society, that is, founded on individualism and therefore not the image of an **atom** with nucleus and electrons may be missing, which takes the adjective “atomized” literally.

Furthermore, modern society is the bearer of liberal democratic principles such as the **right to representation** and **individual freedom**, represented by the two respective illustrations at the bottom of the speech bubble.
In the first case we have a white man who represents the individuals behind him (principle of representation) and therefore in **foreground**; in the second case a little white man holding an **unlocked padlock** in his hands (principle of individual freedom).
All the characters have no characteristics that make them recognizable because they embody **universal principles** of the post-revolutionary, liberal and atomized society that should apply to every individual.

These images embody modern bourgeois society, although the illustration at the top right of the cartoon and further symbols linked to the illustration are missing (we will talk about this later).

## The democratic solution

Faced with a society that is both earthly and material, Marx deploys the ideal of a **substantial democracy** in which each individual no longer lives as an individual in an atomized system but as a component of an entire "démos", that is, an organ community.
Thus, all the erroneous principles linked to the material and the individual are rejected, such as private property and inequalities between citizens.

Through the famous "proletarian revolution" (which we will talk about at the end) Marx aspires to the so-called "**human emancipation**", to the detriment of the current "**political emancipation**", bearer of **formal** equalities which however hide large **substantial** inequalities: this concept resides in the **two signs** at the bottom of the part we are analyzing.
The **burning** of the wooden sign of "_political emancipation_" leads to the **formation** of a further wooden sign with the writing "_human emancipation_", typical of Marx's ideal democracy.
This symbolizes that the second can occur with the sole negation and **elimination** of the first, which burns with the fire of revolution (which as we will see is a recurring iconography in the drawing).

Furthermore, the ideal of **démos** is also recalled, in which in the perspective of human emancipation, each individual is part of a whole: the grains that make up the sign, in fact, go from being separate components to forming a '**totalitarian aggregation**, that of human emancipation itself.

# Economic-philosophical manuscripts

The second work that we will analyze is the collection of the "Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts", in which Marx definitively looks at economic policy.
The illustrative part inherent to these writings is **darker flesh pink**.

## The cage of alienation…

A characteristic illustration of the second compartment is the image of the worker locked behind the bars of the cage called _“alienation”_.

Unlike Hegel and Feuerbach (although inspired more by the latter), Marx maintains that **alienation** must be understood in its socio-economic nature and therefore interpreted as real and not just consciential (as Feuerbach said instead).
In fact, it is a condition which, despite being pathological, also involves a dependence on the given fact: this sad observation is at the basis of the historical role of the **worker** in capitalist society who figuratively finds a place in a **cage** which embodies this same condition.
The worker **suffers the cause** (tears on his face) since he is aware of it and at the same time is represented with the **white complexion**: this is a characteristic of the **universal** worker of society who does not it concerns neither one nor another proletarian but all.

## …and his four keys

The alienation for the worker is analyzed in detail by Marx, who highlights **four fundamental aspects** described in the illustration by the golden keys placed just to the right of the cage.

In particular, Marx states that the proletarian is alienated from: his own **essence** (or Wesen) so free and creative work, typical of the human race, is compromised; one's **activity** as forced and coercive work; the **product** of his activity since it does not belong to him and is not intended for him, thus becoming a sort of purpose for which he works and to which he submits; finally he is alienated from his **neighbour**, that is to say the capitalist, i.e. the one who exploits him as a means and who is entitled to the product of his labor power.

The **four golden keys** summarize precisely this fourfold analysis, as well as the foundation of the same alienation that the worker suffers: consequently the **icons** that they carry on their heads recall the alienating aspects described by Marx.
We therefore have alienation with respect to one's "activity" described by the **hammer**, symbol and work tool (which also takes part in the communist flag); the alienation with respect to "neighbors", taken up by the **stylized face of the bourgeois** (glasses and moustache); alienation from one's "human essence", highlighted by the **open padlock**, symbol of free work; to conclude, the alienation with respect to the "product" of the activity is represented by a **big box**, a symbol of goods (recurring in "Capital" as we will see later).
Their gold color enhances their **universal value** (i.e. their working preciousness) and ideologically opens the same cage in which the worker is closed: if only the worker were to reclaim what he is alienated from, then one's condition of alienation would come to an end.

It should be noted that there is **only one** lock and not four: this suggests that if only the exploited were to take possession of even just one of those four keys, the entire capitalist system would collapse due to which the condition of alienation is suffered.
This happens because all four are ideologically connected to the principle of "private property", the cause of the global mechanism of alienation.

## The foundation of evils: private property

An articulated **blue lace** ties the keys together and at the same time to a box under the cage full of tools/objects; continuing with the observation we notice how it is drawn by the iconic figure of a bourgeois, already mentioned before.

During the drawing you will notice how this character will be recurring and will have the role of always recalling the presence of the capitalist class: it is no coincidence that his **hat** and the **ribbon** that ties the keys are colored **blue**, opposite shade to red or to the proletarian, to his revolution and to Communism.
This illustration recalls **private property**, that is, the possession of the tools used by all workers by the sole exploiter, who drags the **box with the means of work** under his ownership into a somewhat possessive attitude.
Inside the box we distinguish a **wrench**, a **screwdriver tip**, a **sickle** and a **hammer** (further reminders of the fact that the revolution is implied by the capitalist system itself, as we will see), while on the box a **black star** certifies that everything contained is also owned by the individual in the current liberal constitution (it is therefore a principle put for members, exactly like the star). Unknowingly, the bourgeois **drags** to himself the keys to alienation, without realizing the real condition in which his "operators" live; in short, he is not able to think in a “dialectical” way.

## In the mind of the bourgeois

The inability of the bourgeois to think dialectically is expressed and contained in his **thought**, or rather in the **cartoon** already anticipated previously.

The **capitalist** is in fact guilty of mystifying the bourgeois world by unconsciously convincing himself that it is the only possible economic system and as such destined to remain eternally over time: he does not realize the same conflict between capitalist and wage earner; for this reason he is depicted in the act of **ignoring the alienation** of the proletarian and thus observing the ground.
Furthermore, he considers the principles of the capitalist system necessary and for this reason his thought not only lists within itself the pillars of the mystified social system (atomized and liberal democratic society) but **also accepts them** unconditionally: here is the checkbox "_<span className ='tick'>✓</span>_” color **green** expresses precisely this, that is, considering what is right and eternal that which in reality brings with it the contradictions of an inevitable change.

# Theses on Feuerbach

The third work we will talk about is "Theses on Feuerbach", aimed at highlighting the merits and errors of the philosopher of the Hegelian Left but also what was correctly stated by Hegel, previously targeted: in short, Marx **will correct Hegel with Feuerbach and Feuerbach with Hegel**.

It must be specified that this sector is divided into **further parts** which correspond precisely to what Marx agrees with Hegelian thought and what Marx agrees with Feuerbachian thought. In fact, we note that this section of the drawing is raised, as if it were made up of **interlocking puzzles**: the pieces of thoughts of the two authors considered by Marx combine in such a way as to create a unitary thought in what they claim to be correct and eliminating what they claim is wrong under the filter of Marxist inquiry. The colors used are two **brighter** flesh-colored shades.

## Feuerbach's voice

We can understand how Marx was always inspired by Feuerbach's thought, even though in the writing in question he not only recognized its merits but also its errors.
In particular, we must observe the upper right corner in which we can half see **Feuerbach's face**: starting from that exact point we can read from top to bottom what Marx takes into consideration regarding the philosophy of the thinker of the Hegelian left.
Although the communist philosopher states that Feuerbach claimed a fundamental fact of the individual, that is, his concreteness by rejecting Hegel's ideological theories, on the other hand he neglected how historicity is a basic component in the definition of man and therefore more that nature, it is society, that is, history.

This partial agreement with Feuerbach's thought is visible in the illustrations near his face: a **white man** (since universal "man" in the sense of species) is surrounded by **three leaves** and has some **green pupils**. These characteristics accentuate the vital relevance of considering man as **natural concreteness**, symbolized by the leaves and the green color of the pupils.
Furthermore, Feuerbach would say that man is concrete because he is made up of **flesh**, **bones** and **blood**: if you look carefully, not only does the white character exhibit a **wound** on his right arm which sprays blood outside of itself, but near the central part of the section there is a **steak** with some **bones** and a **heart**. Taking Feuerbach's words literally, man's own flesh, bones and blood come to life through these depictions.

## Hegel's voice

Jumping to the bottom of the box, we will once again notice **Hegel's face** glimpsed behind Marx's thick hair: it is from this point onwards that it is possible to understand what is accepted and rejected by Marx in the Hegelian doctrine.
We said that man must consider himself concrete but not nature as Feuerbach intends it, rather historical tradition as made so by it: humanity incarnated in the **colorless individual** with the face replaced by an **hourglass** highlights precisely this, since the hourglass is a symbol of history, or rather of **becoming historical** (as we have already discussed when talking about the universal scope of thought).
This means that the anthropological investigation initiated by Marx always ends up in a historical and **socio-economic** investigation: this last aspect takes hold in the character's right hand, which holds a **coin** (economy ) and a **bill of rights** (society).
That anthropological being is holding the tools “to be understood” in a nutshell.
Precisely this last point fully verifies what we said at the beginning: the universal scope of Marx's thought affects everything and in a single illustration lies the hourglass, the coin and the bill of rights, repeated on the orbits around the head of the portrait of the philosopher.

## The discarded “puzzle pieces”.

It goes without saying that the illustrations covered by a huge red “_<span className='marx'>X</span>_” are the **eliminated pieces of the puzzle**, that is, what is wrong in the thinking of Feuerbach and what is wrong in Hegel's thought.

In fact, Marx rejects Feuerbach's **naturalistic humanism**, in which after all man is not nature but history: the red erasure covers the illustration at the top right where a **tree** and a **plant** of some simplified natural landscape, possess **human arms and heads**, embodying the interpenetration between nature and man.
If we proceed on the imaginary straight line that takes us to the "pivot of the drawing" (i.e. Marx's head) we encounter the correction with Hegel, that is, man and the analysis of him as history.
The other “_<span className='marx'>X</span>_” is instead reserved for the **Hegelian spirit**, where man loses himself in the extreme idealization of reality, or rather a **ghost** light blue (already seen in the first paragraph): once again proceeding on the imaginary straight line originating from Marx's eye, we note Feuerbach's correction to Hegel, that is, man as a concrete individual.

By eliminating these tiles, what remains it is the homogeneous illustration of what Marx sees as most **correct** in the two authors, whose thoughts are not only opposite on a theoretical level but also on a graphic level: surrounded by a white halo (because they are authors who existed and not formulated by his thought), their faces are found at the opposite ends of the analyzed box and also at the two **opposite corners** of the upper margin of the drawing (considering Hegel's face in the first box).

## The religious opium of the people

With particular regard to Feuerbach, Marx states how the thinker of the Hegelian left was able to recognize how **God** is an idea produced by man, legitimizing the reversal of predicative relationships carried out by him: however Marx specifies that the true The causes of the birth of God are identified in the specific society in which man lives and in this case the individual uses religion as an opium against an unjust and overwhelming system, the search for a good that is only possible in the afterlife.

The **cartoon** with the thick black outline containing the **figure of God**, seems to come from **three different sources**: the first leads into the previous panel, from the figure of the **alienated proletarian** in a cage; the second from the incarnation of **man as history and tradition**; the last originates from a cracked cavity framed by two rotating red arrows, symbol of Feuerbach's predicative reversal.
To conclude we can summarize what Marx states about the idea of God and what we want to report in the illustration with the cartoon just described with the following analysis: God is predicated of man, not subject (third origin) and his origin must be sought with a historical-social analysis of the system in which the individual lives (second origin) which shows that religion is the fruit of a sick society, where man is currently unjustly exploited by the capitalist-alienating system (first origin).
From the first to the third we therefore have: the real cause, the method and the intuition of an error.

# German ideology

“The German Ideology” is perhaps one of the most important writings of the Marxist legacy, in which the thinker introduces some important concepts of his thought such as “structure and superstructure”, “historical materialism” and “historical dialectics”.
It is therefore no coincidence that the panel inherent to this work is one of the most full of figures, on the other hand it is surprising that the **dark flesh color** of the section cannot be seen as it is covered by the tones of the visual rays coming from from the two possible approaches to historical analysis.
The last characteristic is that this box must be observed **from left to right** with more rigor than the others.

## The eye of science

Marx specifies that the type of approach that must be applied to human analysis and its evolution in history must necessarily be of a **scientific** type: it is in fact not possible to use **ideology** as a method of analysis because tends to mystify reality and provide a representation of it that is not real, but linked to one's own or other people's vision.

For reasons of space, this predisposition for the scientific approach on Marx's part is represented in illustrations partially hidden behind the hourglass rotating around the philosopher's head. Observing the figures closest to Marx's face, we notice an **eye with a greenish pupil** and a **brain from which eyeballs emerge**: these are the two approaches considered by Marx to the analysis of man and of its history, where however only the "scientific eye" is **circled in green**, while the brain is marked by red "_<span className='marx'>X</span>_", in **rejection sign**.
From both originate the **luminous rays** that invest the subsequent figures, because both illustrations embody the types of approach that Marx explicitly talks about: however the ideology is canceled because the eyes that interpret the outside are linked to a 'personal **idea** of the person who owns it (one's own or others' representation) and therefore of that **brain** that formulates it and validates it as true.
Consequently, the image of the brain wants to enhance the presence of an idea, mystifying compared to the truth.
The green circle instead confirms what Marx said, that is, to be based on a vision free from the idea and the singular mind of the interpreter, an eye **not tied to the brain** and to any ideology but only open to the understanding of objectivity of things and characterized by the **green shade** of the pupil, the symbolic color of science.

## Need, work, satisfaction

To understand what men are, we must proceed with a historical analysis that highlights their role within it: after all, the two luminous rays both hit the **vertical writing** (surrounded by a white halo) of the ”history” which also hangs in the box next since the theme is also taken up later.

History is in fact a material process based on the **need-satisfaction** dialectic which is also what originally distinguished man from the animal. With the awareness of his own need, man established work, creator of civilization and culture (a true historical engine) which brought man himself to satisfaction.
This is what distinguishes him from the animal and also the cyclical illustration represented in the drawing: a depersonalized **man** (featureless and colorless) represents **humanity** itself and its evolution by virtue of perception of a need; an arrow leads the ideal cyclical path to the image of a **sickle** and a **hammer** (another reference to the communist icon) which expresses **work**; to conclude the journey, we reach a **white thumb**, concretizing the **satisfaction** achieved with the work.
It should be noted that it is a **cycle**, therefore something repeatable since the human being has perceived different needs from era to era which has led him to a continuous development of himself and his role.

Paying attention to the figure of the suffering man below, we notice that his thought is reduced to an elementary cartoon with an **exclamation** and a **question** point: they summarize the mechanism according to which man **he surprisingly realizes** the tension of the need he perceives and the act with which he **asks** for a possible way out, a way to satisfy it.

## The “structure” of the factory

Proceeding with the reading of the box, we come to an iconic illustration enclosed in the layout of a **factory**: in this complex the concept of structure and superstructure applies, fundamental for the understanding of "historical materialism".
The general layout is divided into **levels** and the two elements that constitute the "**structure**" are located in the earthly one, that is, the economic skeleton of society (for Marx) and the structural system of industry in the design : in particular we have the "productive forces" on the left and the "production relations" on the left.

It should also be specified that the image of the factory acquires strong value in conceiving the **environment** in which Marxist ideology spread: an industrial landscape, populated by enormous factory complexes like that one. To conclude, we must explicitly refer to the fact that Marx considers structure as a truly determining element of history; for this reason it corresponds to the **ground floor**, without it the entire factory would not exist.

## Workers, machines and technology

By **productive forces**, we mean the set of three different elements: the **work force**, i.e. the workers who produce; the **means of production**, i.e. the tools for work and machinery; the **technical-scientific knowledge** to organize the best production.
These three factors are symbolically depicted in the drawing in the first left half where respectively we have: a **worker** for the personification of the workforce (depicted with the green and blue overalls, as we will see several times in the drawing); a **conveyor belt and associated machinery** to create the means of production; a **book** with a red cover and the title “_science_” as a conservator of technical-scientific knowledge in order to develop capitalized production.

A symbolic feature on the worker is the **blue overalls**: this is the typical color of the bourgeois hat (as we have seen) and opposite to the symbolic red, the color of communism. This means that the man-producer is subjected and subjugated to capitalist society, forced to wear that symbolic work outfit in a system **contrasting** with the mature communist society.

## Human relationships

Beyond the writing “_vs_” (which we will clarify later) we notice the other half, the right one on the ground floor: these are the **production relations** that are established between men in a specific economic-social formation, in this case those established between proletarian and capitalist.

In this half, in fact, a **bourgeois** and a **worker** are represented facing each other in their iconic guises: this figurative choice in fact aims to connect the two figures, representatives of the two respective social classes.
However, Marx specifies that these relationships on a juridical level are expressed as property relationships, which can be summarized in the principle of **private property**.
In fact, between the two figures there is a **box with tools**: by observing carefully, you can see how that box is identical to the one depicting private property in the second compartment of the drawing. The appeal of private property between the two classes therefore expresses the production relations of the capitalist system.

## The smoke from the superstructure

Let's skip the analysis of the first floor of the factory, and arrive at its **smoking chimneys**, from which the **superstructure** originates: Marx in fact considers the legal relationships, the culture, the artistic and religious doctrines, the forces policies and ethics as expressions of what lies at the base, that is, the structure.

From a graphic point of view therefore, the **smoke** above originates from the industry itself which embodies the structure on the lowest level and what originates from its system is the superstructure itself, i.e. the clouds of smoke containing several images: a **hammer** for **legal relationships**; a **Latin cross** for **religious doctrine**; a **crown** for the **political forces**; a **brush** for **artistic doctrine**.
They express in general all the most important and representative cultural spheres mentioned by Marx.

It must be recognized that these elements belonging to the totality of the State are "**determined and conditioned**" at the same time by the same structure: this expression used by Marx indicates that they are dependent on the structure, without however being mechanically and excessively determined by it, as the clouds originating from the chimney do not depend on it in a mechanical way (in fact Marx uses the expression soap bubbles, very similar conceptually to the clouds in question).

## Proletariat “VS” bourgeoisie

Having established the concept of structure and superstructure, we can now introduce the so-called "historical materialism": even before moving on to this concept, it is important to look at what is depicted on the second floor, i.e. the **law of history**, i.e. its propulsion engine.

In fact, on the first floor the two social classes of the proletarian and the capitalist are placed in open **contrast**, embodied in their respective symbolic characters and separated by a convoluted line with the writing _“vs”_, which expresses their struggle.
In particular, the law of historical becoming is a contrast between a **rising class** (proletariat), embodying the **productive forces** we talked about on the ground floor on the left, and a **ruling class** (bourgeoisie ), embodied in the **production relations**, specified on the ground floor on the right.
This correspondence highlights the reason why the writing _“vs”_ is also found below and why the productive forces are found on the left (like the proletarian) and the productive relations are found on the right (like the bourgeois).

We note that the first floor of the industrial plant is **open to the outside**, almost as if to connect with a further illustration: Marx reports the example of the **French Revolution** as an occasion for conflict between class ascendancy (bourgeoisie) and ruling class (aristocracy), which brought the former to power to the detriment of the latter, managing to impose its own property relations and its own vision of the world.
The French Revolution of the 18th century is iconographically present in the drawing with a **French flag**, flanked by the **fire** of the revolution (recurring iconography in the drawing) and a **rifle with bayonet**, symbol of freedom: this illustration is openly inspired by the work “**_Liberty leading the people_**” by the French painter Eugene Delacroix, from which two iconic symbols were taken, such as the rifle and the flag.
This revolution is mentioned in the work in order to state that this explosive opposition also occurs in the current capitalist society, which therefore brings with it the need for socialism.

## Historical materialism

The conclusion of the meaning hidden under all these representations is expressed in the already mentioned "historical materialism": it is a concept that highlights how history is determined by socio-economic, not spiritual forces since at the base there is a **social structure -economical**.

The writing “**historical materialism**” runs diagonally upwards, tangential to the upper edge of the box on a **wooden sign**: everything below seems to gather and create a separate part in the box, that is, the definition of the structures that determine and define that same materialism, in turn embodied in something strictly "material", that is, the factory symbol of the system. However, when Marx approaches history he also speaks of the great eras referring to precise economic-social formations.

## The six formations

These **economic-social formations** take place at the top of the box: we note that six different illustrations are stacked, each showing a different system belonging to a specific era. If you observe carefully, each part has its **number** (i.e. the position in Marx's "evolutionary" classification) and is read ascendingly.

• The **primitive community** is the first and is depicted at the bottom right of the analyzed "block": what is depicted is a **bonfire**, a typical symbol of the primitive human community and around which men gathered.

• The second is the **Asian society**, represented by the stylized geographical continent of **Asia**, of which the writing is also shown in case it is not understandable.

• In the third position we have the **ancient society**, here interpreted under the name of the Greek one: for this reason it is configured in an **Ionic style column**, recognizable as such by the capital.

• The **feudal society** is the fourth formation analyzed by Marx: it is embodied in the image of an **enclosed land** with a house that can be glimpsed. This is feudal property, typical of this era.

• In penultimate place we have **bourgeois society**, depicted with the iconic features of a **face of a bourgeois**; mustache, glasses and top hat (as we have already seen before).

• In sixth position we have what the current capitalist system is directed towards by historical dialectics, that is the **future communist society**, obviously enclosed in the symbol of the **sickle** and the **hammer** on a black background. The latter, however, is not a fragment like the others, but is a cavity from which this sort of black circle can be glimpsed, connected to a pole below and coming from the lower panel (for a reason that we will specify).

# Communist Manifesto

The red color becomes more and more intense and now in the box of the "Communist Manifesto" we are in the presence of a **brick-light** shade.
This is in fact one of the most famous writings of the philosopher, as well as very **influential** in the political conception of the time: we will see that everything revolves around three main themes such as the analysis of the historical function of the bourgeoisie, the concept of history as class struggle and criticism of false (non-scientific) socialisms.

## What a struggle it is!

We have already identified that the writing _“history”_ **hangs** with its last two letters in the box below together with an iconic **torn coin** with the writing _“vs”_.
In fact, Marx further takes up the contradictions of the capitalist system by speaking of something that has generated and awakened a **contrast** that he is unable to control: that between productive forces (proletarian) and relations of production (capitalist), already expressed in the paragraph previous.

The **white halo** is also maintained in the part of the writing in the current box, since _“history”_ is the topic covered and the class struggle is its subject, in this case expressed with the sign _“vs ”_ and its laceration in the middle (reviving the iconography used previously since the struggle we are talking about is the same after all). If you look more carefully, you notice how a **quote from Marx** written in black and white appears to be linked to the thread: **_“Proletarians of all countries… unite!”_**
With this Marx wants to designate a true proletarian **internationalism**, which invests the workers of all countries with a practical mission: it is intended to unify them in the name of a constructive revolution for society and definitively destructive for capitalism.

## Bourgeois ignorance

Temporarily leaving aside the great wheel of "false socialisms", we observe the iconic figure (already repeated in the drawing) of the **bourgeois**, whose gaze seems to be turned upwards.
Behind him the sign of the _"revolution"_ rests on a **black pole**, coming from the box above: it is that of the _"future communist society"_, represented by the hammer and sickle which can only be achieved with that same one * *revolution** brought back to the origin of its pillar.

However, the bourgeois **ignores** her with his back to her, does not see the current contrasts and does not see the inevitable class struggle led by the proletariat, so much so that he **observes** the contrasts reported in the part above and holds on with doubt **two question marks** (surrounded by a luminous halo to be exalted): his **ignorance** deprives the understanding and dominion of that intrinsic and necessary conflict of his own system.
It should be noted that the representation of doubt is also blue in colour, like the bourgeois' hat: in fact, it proceeds with a purely capitalist vision and is not able to scientifically analyze the whole of its system, not noticing the **need for revolution** (blue as opposed to red).

## The tripartite wheel of false socialisms

Particularly important is the criticism conducted against non-scientific socialisms, which make fundamental errors that Marx lays bare and which are represented in this characteristic **tripartite wheel**: in fact the **false socialisms** are **three**.

The wheel is a purely **aesthetic** choice and the position of its writing _“false socialisms”_ follows this rotary movement; different question regarding its **relief** and the shadows given around it: it is something in relief above the drawing, that is, something to be taken and eliminated since it is what Marx opposes, not what he supports. This vision is made problematic by the overlying figure of the bourgeois even if his ignorance is excluded and refuted by Marx, as is obvious.

• The first in Marxist aims is **reactionary** socialism, that is, a system linked to the past rather than to the future: here we do not want to look towards a revolution that will be, but towards parameters that were. Marx describes him as the one who "**turns the wheel of history backwards**".
The upper left part depicts a **metallic wheel** that appears to rotate backwards, and it is the wheel of history to which Marx refers as it has an **hourglass** in the middle (recurring as an incarnation of history in drawing).
His motion is explicitly presented with **red arrows** which make it rotate in the opposite direction, since the right direction is indicated by a small sign with **double arrows** which opposes the substantial motion of that wheel. Furthermore, the direction of movement is accentuated by the **perspective** used for the wheel; it shows the thickness on the right and this gives a visual impact that makes us immediately understand that it is rotating to the left.

• The second non-scientific socialism is the **conservative** one: it aims to preserve (typical of the bourgeois) the current system **curing its defects** and correcting its drawbacks, without however definitively destroying itself.
In Marx's "scientific" perspectives, the capitalist system must be annihilated, without compromises or modifications. This concept is found in the lower section of the tripartite division, where a **coin** symbol of capitalism is **protected behind a noticeboard** as a sign of **conservation**: although the coin in the drawing would more generally indicate a reference to the economy, in this case it refers to the actual money in the sense of **material property** to which men are conditioned in this capitalist system. On the other hand, it refers to the actual **economy**, coherently with the other recurring symbols: after all, it is a question of preserving the economic structure of capitalism, which is the basis of the system as we have said.
The other elements are a **eraser**, symbol of "**correction of problems**" (as if it were an error to be erased) and a **medical red cross**, symbol of "**cure of defects**” as specified at the beginning. In particular, the rubber has the writing _“Proudhon”_ in italics on its protection, i.e. the surname of the greatest exponent of conservative socialism, which Marx had already targeted in other writings.

• Finally we have **critical-utopian** socialism in the orange section, typical of pre-Marxist ideas.
In fact, it is a question of appealing to all social classes for the purpose of a **peaceful reform action**, without recognizing the revolutionary autonomy typical of the proletariat.
This moralistic and utopian dimension is represented by the image of a red and white **megaphone**: it recalls the **general appeal** to all social classes for the purpose of the "peaceful" reform represented by the **white flag**, icon of the absence of revolution and struggle of the proletariat.
If you carefully note below we also have the image of a **rainbow heart**, a further reference to the useless **peace** of the reforms decreed by this socialism.

# The capital

We have arrived at probably Marx's most important writing; "The capital".
The work became particularly important and a model for the classics of Marxism: it highlights the **mechanisms of bourgeois society** in order to reveal its economic law, since it is characteristic of a specific economic system and is not universal.
In particular, Marx highlights the essence of Capitalism itself, namely that of accumulating capital by the capitalist alone through multiple exploited workers.

The entire illustration inherent to the writing is placed in the penultimate box, in which the **red color is intensifying** more and more. At the same time the concepts are illustrated by means of an ideal path that takes place by means of a **machinery**/conveyor belt: this is a choice that on the one hand once again recalls the **environment** towards which these theories are addressed and gives the idea in which they operate; on the other hand, this figurative approach turns out to be **congenial to the thought** it wants to express.

## The goods and their value

In this box appears the iconic **box** of **merchandise** (already encountered), understood as one of the conceptual pillars of "Capital": that box, exactly like the commodity for Marx, has a value determined overall by the " use value” and “exchange value”.

Looking at the brick red box located on the entrance of the machine, you will notice two black connections, which, like a diagram, connect **two colored circles** to the goods: the **blue** one is the **use value**, that is, what that commodity is used for in the practical act and it is represented by a **white hand**, symbol of action, manual skill and therefore use; the **red** one is the **exchange value**, i.e. the possibility that it can be exchanged.
However, in this last case we would not understand what it means to represent a **white arm in muscular tension**: Marx states that the exchange value is determined by the quantity of **labour power** socially necessary to produce it (socially, because deals with the average social productivity of a historical system) and therefore figuratively materializes in an arm showing its muscular strength. After all, it is precisely in this area that, as we will see, Marx will extract proletarian exploitation and therefore that need for revolution typical of Capitalism (it is no coincidence that the red color of the circle was chosen again to symbolize this intrinsic communist revolution).

To conclude the discussion, Marx states that usually on the market the goods are displayed with a **price**, which, being dependent on other factors, is not representative of the pure exchange value: on the box, next to the _“M”_ of goods a **label** with the triple **dollar** symbol is glued to indicate the price, from which the link with the exchange value originates.
Consequently, the iconography of the red circle almost wants to clarify that at the basis of that price (dollars) there is a value that cannot be represented in its pure state, even if the price itself is not a faithful reflection of it.

## Against commodity fetishism

Even before delving into the structure of the machinery, we must analyze the **wooden sign** that emerges from behind it, near the box: it is Marx's rejection of **commodity fetishism**, who maintains that it can be accepted that goods have value in themselves.
The sign therefore categorically **bans** with a red “_<span className='marx'>X</span>_” a **gold box**, or rather a gold commodity: it has value **in itself** as golden, but this is not how it works in the laws of the capitalist system which provides for a link between the commodity and worker exploitation.

## The market machine: DMD'

As we have introduced, the **grey machinery** that looms large in the center of the box has the function of expressing a passage, a path: that of the **market**, where the capitalist formula **DMD'** is explained. This acronym coined by Marx serves to reflect on how the subject who invests money (D) to produce a commodity (M) has the aim of obtaining more money (M') with the same commodity produced.

We therefore note that the **letters** are shown in the drawing in conceptual form: the _“M”_ of the box confirms its role as **goods**, while on the front of the machine there are a “_D_” and a “_D '_” and the underlying coin collectors.
In short, what the drawing wants to convey is Marx's own message, according to which the commodity, passing through the market mechanism (production and sale) represented by the machinery, acquires an increase in value which leads the bourgeois to earn more than that he spent to produce it. In fact, near the entrance of the machine there is a sort of small **money deposit** under the "_D_" with **four coins** inside (with the usual and iconic dollar), destined to spill into the cavity behind it (i.e. being run over).
Near the exit from the machine there is a sort of **tap** from which the coins come out, collecting in a second deposit; if you count the coins they are no longer four but **five** and this quantitative increase expresses the **increase in value** of the commodity and the profit of the capitalist, which occurs at the end of the operation of the money machine market.
This apparently anomalous increase in value is called “**surplus value**” by Marx.

## A machine powered by manpower

The sign of _“surplus value”_ is shown on the machine at its center, as if it were a title: after all, observing the system described previously we understand what Marx meant with this “increase in value”, however the real cause can be read in the * *internal systems** of the car, behind the glass.
However, observing the actual writing of surplus value, we read how the writing _“-value”_ is white, while the writing _“plus-_ “is **red**: the philosopher states that the origin of surplus value it is an **addition of labor power** that the worker offers free of charge to the capitalist, since he is forced to sell himself on the market to make a living.
The red of the word _"plus"_ reflects the fact that the increase is given by the work of the proletarian, whose echo in the drawing is (as we have seen) given by the color of the revolution.

In fact, we note that in the central glassy column, we can glimpse a **container connected to a tube**: this is the mechanism that makes the market work by virtue of an increase in profit compared to investment. The **tank** at the base of the tube should in fact contain the **extra workforce**, i.e. the direct producer of the surplus value and therefore containing what powers the machinery; if you look at the container it shows a **circular icon** of a white arm next to a _“+”_.
The muscular arm follows the iconography used to explain the exchange value of the commodity and for this reason embodies the workforce, while the _“+”_ at its side indicates that the strength used is more than that for which it was purchased, therefore there is a free contribution from the proletarian.
The tube and the tank were shown faded because the glass window of the machinery is in front of them.

## Variable capital and constant capital

Marx specifies that the capitalist's profit does not correspond to surplus value, this is because there is a fundamental difference between variable capital and constant capital.

This distinction is illustrated beyond the machinery, by two enormous gray **barrels** containing two types of different objects: one of them is the **variable capital** and it is what the capitalist spends to purchase the workforce, i.e. the workers; the other is **constant capital**, i.e. the investment for the acquisition of the means of production.
Beyond the conveyor belt, on the right, we immediately see a darker container containing the **tanks of the workforce** that feed the machinery: let's therefore say that the price reported out of the barrel is the same **salary** with which the owner “buys” the worker, i.e. the fuel for the increase in value. The other large, nearby and lighter container preserves **metal gears** which represent the means of production: it is no coincidence that those same metal wheels are found at the ends of the **conveyor belt** like **pins** around to which the tape itself runs.
On the respective containers there are the words _“C.V.”_ and _“C.C.”_ which stand for variable capital and constant capital, indicative of what they represent. It goes without saying that the plaques with dollars refer to a hypothetical price to be paid to renew production tools and producers.

## The formulas of the capitalist system

The ideal path of the goods ends with the **end of the belt**, beyond which we notice a box falling (further goods) partially hidden behind a **wooden sign** in the foreground on which the **laws of the capitalist system**.
As we anticipated, there is a difference between profit and surplus value and it is only visible in the mathematical formulas used to estimate their rate.

• _“s. of the plus. = plus. / c.v.”_: in this formula shown above first, the **rate of surplus value** is the ratio between surplus value and variable capital, i.e. wages.
On the drawing the terms are shown in a simplified form but in reality they would be written as follows: **rate of surplus value = surplus value / variable capital**.

• _“s. of the prof. = plus. / (c.c. + c.v.)”_: in this other formula reported secondly below, the **rate of profit** is the ratio between the surplus value and the sum of the variable capital and the constant capital.
On the drawing the terms are shown in a simplified form but in reality they would be written as follows: **rate of surplus value = surplus value / (variable capital + constant capital)**.

## Absolute surplus value or relative surplus value?

Let's now look at the **two signs** just below the formulas just explained.
In order to increase surplus value, the capitalist initially aims to extend the working day of his workers following the principle of "**relative surplus value**", where there are limits due to the worker's efficiency after a certain hour: this means that the proletarian does not work so effectively after a certain time since the productivity of his workforce ceases and the increase in value does not appear to be clearly certain. The relative surplus value is represented by a sign with a clock flanked by the **sign** _“+”_: in fact it involves **increasing working time**.

Rather, Marx states that capitalism focuses more on decreasing working time to reintegrate part of the wages of extra hours now omitted: it is the "**absolute surplus value**", which guarantees greater productivity and is represented by a sign with a clock flanked by the sign _”-“_, as it provides for a **decrease in working time**.
We therefore note how the entire system is rooted in private profit, rather than in the common interest; this will be the conduct that will lead capitalism to its own collapse, as Marx highlights.

## Overabundance and anarchy: towards collapse

Beyond our conveyor belt, we have a **falling box** behind the Laws of Capitalism sign, heading towards all the **other collected boxes** at the base of the panel.

Taking into consideration that the iconography of the box always embodies the goods, their overabundance recalls the concept of **overproduction**. In fact, Marx specifies that the **machine**, unlike the owner, maintains constant productivity even in the face of an increase in the working day: it allows not only to increase the absolute surplus value, but also the relative surplus value.
By using funds in machinery, the bourgeois aims to guarantee greater earnings by producing the most sought-after goods without having a real guide or limit: this fully expresses the so-called "**anarchy of production**", which leads to having an overabundance of goods where the profit seems to be higher.
This cause-effect mechanism is represented by those same boxes (goods), present in **indefinite number** and destined to increase their quantity (since another one is immediately arriving); they are "returned" by the **overlying machinery**, to indicate the efficiency of the machine identified by the capitalist in the context of production.
A small **sign** with the writing _“A”_ for **anarchy**, emerges from behind the goods and indicates the anarchy of production proper to the capitalist system, in which everyone goes it alone and where those same goods they were produced under the sign of this same anarchy.
An imminent crisis and a subsequent confirmed collapse are inevitable.

## A capitalist and many wage earners

Technological renewal (i.e. implementing the machine) inevitably leads to a fall in the rate of profit, due to an immeasurable growth of constant capital.
This has as a consequence a **total collapse**, in which therefore both the rate of profit and that of surplus value fall: this is demonstrated by the **two small red arrows** pointing downwards, next to the mathematical formulas already explained previously .
They indicate that by virtue of the underlying overproduction, the two rates are **decreasing**.

This is followed by a **general impoverishment** of the system, in which even the capitalist no longer enjoys a net profit and the limited number of those who enjoy capital decreases: this creates a huge split between the too many who become impoverished and the very few who get rich.
This final and fatal distinction for the capitalist system can be seen in correspondence with a **coin with mustache and glasses** with dollar lenses: this last iconography expresses the great wealth of the **few capital magnates** left after overproduction . The crown highlights how these individuals are the only rich people and governors of society, while glasses and mustaches once again reflect the somatic features of the bourgeois.
In contrast to it in front of a woody background (poor material compared to the gold of the currency) just below is the **horde of wage earners**, whose quantity has increased after the crisis of the system: a general impoverishment also brings to what Marx calls "**the industrial reserve army**", i.e. the mass of unemployed workers who can no longer be "purchased" by the impoverishment of the capitalist himself.

# Criticism of the Gotha program

We have finally reached Marx's last writing, where however the concepts addressed do not strictly belong to the scope of the work, but are sometimes introduced in other Marx manuscripts.

The color used as a background is **intense red** (but also in several other elements in the box), typical of the communist flag and of Marx's pupil in the drawing: on the other hand we will see that it is precisely here that the proletarian revolution that has come about materializes overturn the capitalist system.
The box must be read **from right to left** and it ends under the philosopher's beard.

## The proletarian revolution

We begin the analysis of this last part of the drawing by taking into consideration the previous iconography or the **horde of proletarians**, who if previously wanted to represent the many workers (against the capitalist alone) now want to preserve the union of many under a single sign: the famous "proletarian revolution", written on the **red cloth** (still the color of the revolution) placed like a poster.
Note that the “**proletarian river**” passes through the threshold of proletarian revolution, emancipating a fundamental **transition** from capitalism to communism.

However, the importance of all those figures is not the same: at the head of the line there is an individual who is more important than the others, that is, the personification of the **new man**. Marx claims that the future communist society is a pure man and **uncontaminated by material will**, who no longer gives value to ownership and consumption, which are fundamental in the man-world relationship of the capitalist system.
Observing the somatic features, one notices not only the anger expressing revolutionary fury but also the typical characteristics of a **monkey**: this ploy aims to observe how man must not return to a primordial state, but rather to a * *pure state** and not tied to ownership.

## The methods of the revolution: between violence and peace

Marx admits two possible approaches to **revolutionary praxis**; it is the peaceful one and the violent one where the latter has a more decisive function in his thinking.
These two possible methodological paths are embodied in the two **red arms**, emerging from behind the proletarian revolution.
The first of them is the **silver hand**, the one characterized by its **peaceful** expression with two fingers raised; This one, however, holds nothing unlike the one next to it.
The hand on the left is the **golden** one and held in a violent grip: it expresses the revolutionary path of **violence**, which holds within itself the apparent puppet of a bourgeois with a torn torso.

The characters to which this representation conceptually refers are two: firstly it represents the violence and the main path identified by Marx, which as such oppresses the minority of previous oppressors by means of the **dictatorship** of the many revolutionaries previously tormented; the concept of "**oppress**" is fully expressed in the suffocating expression of the poor **bourgeois puppet** with _"X"_ eyes.
Secondly, it concludes a sort of **narrative strand** of the bourgeois himself, or rather of the capitalist system: in the second box the bourgeois exercises the right of private property (the system is standing); in the fifth box we have a bourgeois who does not understand and ignores the contrasts of the system in which he operates and governs (the system is weakened); finally in the last panel we have reached the defeat of the bourgeois (the system has been overturned).
It is obvious to say that consequently there is also a proletarian one, who progressively acquires awareness and imposition of himself in the system (also expressed by the figure of the proletarian described previously).

## The State is going up in smoke

Next to the figure of the proletarian who leads the revolution, there is a curious painting with a factory in flames: it is the **destruction of the State** as the ultimate objective of the revolutionary act.
Marx argues that the State is a machine to be destroyed because it has always privileged the interests of those who led it and not the common good.
The deterioration of the State exists in the iconic representation of an **industrial plant in smoke** bearing the word "State": in fact, recalling the previous illustrations (those in the fourth box) it seems to be the structure and superstructure that describes the state plant of the capitalism. But Marx does not talk about taking possession of that ideological machine, but rather about destroying it and annihilating it in the **fire of the revolution**.
In this sense, the flames that embody the inevitable clash have the aim of becoming, in practice, true revolutionary destroyers who do not live in the theoretical framework alone but emerge from it.

## The post-capitalist and pre-communist society

Marx states the existence of two phases of communist society: one of the two is the more mature and complete one that we will see later; the other, however, is the preliminary one, that is, a crude communism still linked to the concept of property and paid work.

The philosopher specifies that in this last **transitional phase**, everyone becomes proletarian and society itself becomes a large capitalist employer, in which there is still an interest in **material possession**.
Under this sign, the first phase of communist society is represented by a wooden sign which also seems to be hampered at the base by flames: on it there is still the **iconic box of private property**, with this time the writing _“For everyone”_.

This signature indicates that material possession has not been eliminated but **collectivized** and with it also **woman**: if you look more carefully, you will see a highly stylized female figure in the box. Marx states this based on the bourgeois concept of marriage, according to which one's woman becomes everyone's as if she were a material good and she must therefore satisfy common needs in the sexual field. A vision of this kind will clearly be superseded by the more complete form of communist society.

## Final communism and perfect equality

We have almost reached the end of the long journey into Marx's thought: all that remains is to specify **the most complete form of communist society**.
It is characterized (in addition to the characteristics outlined so far) by a superior equality that neglects that of crude communism.

Looking at the last illustrationof the paragraph, it is enclosed between the thin wooden walls of a **bipartite room**: first from the right we encounter crude communism, marked by the number _“2”_ **silver** in which an equal right is established which * *does not take individual differences into account**. In short, it is an imperfect and typically still bourgeois equality, whose crudeness is expressed by the **tear** to the number banner. In that first part of the room any two individuals are placed on the **same level** of the pedestal without taking into account the disadvantage in terms of height of either of them.

In the second half however, we have the number _“1”_ **golden** to indicate that we have finally reached the most complete form of communist society: a system that takes into account individual differences and where the pedestals **adapt** to the measurements of the individuals represented in order to make them reach the same overall height, or rather a **perfect equality**.

                                                                                                                                                                                         **__**
