# <span className='comte'>COMTE</span>: THE DAWN OF POSITIVISM

The protagonist of the drawing is the founder of the philosophical current characteristic of the second half of the 19th century: **Positivism**.
**August Comte** is in fact recognized as one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century and his philosophical system is accurately illustrated through precise iconography.
It is essential to know that the French philosopher was the founder of that branch of positivist philosophy called "**Social Positivism**" together with the British thinker John Stuart Mill, alongside "Evolutionary Positivism" represented by the English philosopher Herbert Spencer.

Before even starting to talk about Comte's philosophy, it is important to specify that this current of thought was born in that atmosphere of **scientific progress** identified as human progress: the panorama is that of new inventions and new technological developments that have characterized the change of cities and industrial plants. It is no coincidence that the background of the drawing is made up of red and orange shapes without defined contours in the shape of gears (symbols of technology), dominated by a sky made up of greyish bands, reminiscent of the smoke from industrial chimneys.

From a philosophical point of view therefore, Positivism favors **science** and all its branches as an instrument of true, useful and profitable knowledge.

## Theology, childhood and theocratic and military monarchy

The starting point of Comte's thought is constituted by the "**Law of the three stages**" according to which knowledge in the course of humanity's life has passed through three distinct phases.
Furthermore, to each of these phases, Comte places a specific biological phase of human life and a specific political-social form.

The first stage is the "**theological**" one and is symbolically represented behind the right shoulder of the philosopher, as evidenced by the number _"1"_ on the red band.
Based on the faculty of imagination, the first phase corresponds biologically to **infancy** and leads to interpreting nature, its purposes and its causes with supernatural agents and entities: hence the image of the **baby** showing in the pupil the stylized image of a **god**, or rather of a divine and **supernatural** entity to which the explanations of the phenomena that occur in nature and that man (the baby in this phase) observes.
At the same time, this stage is traced back to the political and social organization of the **theocratic-military monarchy**, as evidenced by the infant's cap, the grenade, the pistols and buckshot but above all the **iron grip** of the hand behind the head of the child. This latter iconography is a symbol of **military strength** and absolute authority, since the back of the hand bears the tattoo of a crown and firmly grips an assault rifle to indicate that the iron and employable military force is sovereign absolute.

## Metaphysics, youth and popular sovereignty

Moving your gaze to Comte's left shoulder you will see the illustration of the second stage of knowledge, that is to say more of a sort of transition between the first and the third (as Comte specifies).

He uses the iconography of the pupil reflecting the explanation of what he sees in front of him again, this time reporting the stylized image of an **open** hand raised upwards, as if to exercise an ** invisible force **.
This is precisely the "**metaphysical**" stage in which natural phenomena are filtered by speculative reason and explained by means of abstract forces.
In this case we have moved on to the biological phase of **youth** and this explains the writing _“-TEEN”_ under the eye of the central character and in the foreground.
Finally, the metaphysical stage corresponds to **popular sovereignty** in which everyone governs without distinction: "indistinctly" is rendered by the lack of bodily, facial and expressive details of the characters (including the one in the foreground), portrayed as **mannequins **, all equipped with a crown.
The number _“2”_, i.e. the corresponding phase number, is engraved on the crown of the central hominid.

## Positivism, maturity and scientific organization of society

The formulation of immutable and scientific laws is typical of the "**positive**" stage in which scientific reason takes over, an instrument of authentic knowledge according to the philosopher.

The third stage is represented by the large **figure of Comte** who embodies the third phase of individual biological growth, i.e. the adult one: next to his head there is in fact a crown bearing the number _"3"_ (detached from his head for a specific reason that we will see later).
The portrait embodies the biological phase of **maturity** as well as the matured vision of humanity with the advent of the positivist doctrine.
The corresponding political and social organization is the **scientific** one, which as we will see later materializes in the ideal "Sociocracy" (depicted in the thinker's head).
In this last stage, the philosopher's pupil is not filled with any figurative icon as the explanation that Comte himself provides of natural phenomena materializes in science and in its new hierarchization, placed in his hands under the name of "Positive Philosophy ”.

## Positive Philosophy

In order to remedy the social crisis caused by the contemporary presence in civilization of the three interpretative forms of the Law of the stages of knowledge, Comte proposes a **reorganization** of the hierarchical system of scientific knowledge by means of Positive Philosophy.
Thus was born "**the Encyclopedia of Sciences**" in which the latter are ordered by increasing complexity, by chronological insertion in the positive phase (and therefore by historical order of their development) and by degree of generality of the phenomena analyzed (and therefore pedagogical order of their learning).
In the drawing it is floating in the hands of its author and bears the title of _“positive philosophy”  _.

The reading order in the illustration is from top to bottom and therefore **astronomy**, **physics**, **chemistry**, **biology** and **sociology**, all accompanied by illustrative drawings with a dual function: to present the individual doctrines in a figurative sense and at the same time indicate that they refer to the analysis of **concrete phenomena**, as Comte specifies.

Furthermore, knowing how to interpret natural phenomena thanks to the study of these sciences means for Comte formulating laws that **dominate nature** itself since every single natural event is predictable and tamable by man: this concept of "possessing knowledge" and "dominating the object of that knowledge" (i.e. nature) is expressed by Comte's hands which in the drawing emphasize the act of possessing and closing the "hierarchy of sciences", i.e. true knowledge.

## The “excluded doctrines”

In the act of theoretically classifying the sciences, Comte also specifies that some doctrines of knowledge do not fall within the new hierarchy: they are therefore "**doctrines excluded** from the new positive organization" and the French thinker specifies that they are mathematics, logic and psychology.

• The first of all is **mathematics** and is considered as the first science to enter the positive stage compared to all the others, which is why it should be considered implicit in the classification and it is no coincidence that it is written in brackets in the drawing , even before astronomy.
However, mathematics distances itself from other doctrines as it lacks concretely analyzable phenomena and, precisely, next to its writing in brackets there is no drawing.

• **Logic** is not considered by Comte as a science but as the method of scientific doctrines themselves, used by all: apparently it is not present in the drawing, yet it will be revealed by illuminating the white box of Positive Philosophy from behind the sheet with which the writing _“logic”_ will appear as if it were the **methodological background** of all classified sciences.

• Finally, **psychology** is considered impossible by the positivist philosopher, since one cannot observe **oneself** internally and study (or interpret) oneself: which is why the writing _“psychology”_ is written on a broken piece of paper , outside the Encyclopedia of Sciences and fluttering near the philosopher's left hand.

## From sociology to Sociocracy

**Sociology** is the highest knowledge as it remedies the lack of "social physics" and its principles favor the advent of the new scientific social organization: **Sociocracy**.
The latter is illustrated in **Comte's head** because it is an "ideal social system", which therefore lives in the philosopher's mind but without actually existing.

Sociology (and therefore Sociocracy) is based on two concepts, those of "**social dynamics**" and "**social statics**", represented by the division of space in half and by arrows.
Social dynamics is the progress that characterizes the **development** of society, while social **statics** are the order that exists between the two components of society, namely politics and human civilization.

Above the golden pedestal of Sociocracy, the philosopher's mind is completely divided in half: the blue part is **politics**, concretized by the presence of papers, written laws, documents and coins; while the red part is **human civilization** in which depersonalized individuals with an unknown identity (as it concerns all of humanity and not definable single individuals) are presented as **individuals** who express thoughts and ideas.
Both components are equipped with an **arrow** each, direct representatives of progress of one and the other part: they are both facing upwards (progress), parallel to each other and characterized by the exact same measurements, especially the **height** (the only different thing is the color).

All this means that the development that affects the social system must take place **equally** in human civilization and in politics, in the same measures, avoiding one of the two parts being excessively developed compared to the other, thus causing a social crisis.
This is the theoretical pillar for implementing Sociocracy in practice.

Finally, the choice to depict the coordinated development of society in the mind of the philosopher is linked to a precise meaning residing in Comte's theories regarding social progress, according to which it occurs thanks to the contribution of the so-called "**men of genius**": it is their head that led to the development of the social system and as such Comte's can also ideally be counted among them.

## The triple meaning of the crown

The **crown** drawn at the top near the philosopher's head has a triple meaning.

• First of all, the crown highlights the **arrival point** of the Law of the three stages in which science becomes sovereign in the corresponding political-social form: it is no coincidence that the reading of the three stages of knowledge in the design occurs as a **triangle/pyramid** (left, right, top center) in which the positive stage is at the ideal summit.

• The second meaning attributed to it is linked to the image of Comte and man as **dominator of nature** and its phenomena thanks to the study of scientific doctrines (this aspect is also mainly highlighted by the position of the philosopher's hands, as we have already said).

• Finally, the third meaning is a reference to the link between the thinker and his thought, that is between Comte and the Sociocracy: the philosopher places himself at the **head** of the Sociocratic System but it is a pure **idealization** as this social organization does not really exist and Comte is not its head.
However, the crown is represented because the drawing is a real eye in the mind of the thinker in question and it is precisely here that he himself places himself at the head of his social system, aware of not being so in fact: here the latter statement is linked to the meaning of the crown **detached from the head**, as it exists but only in Comte's thoughts and is not actually placed on his head.

## The deification of man: the final fall

The last part to be analyzed in the drawing is the one located near the lower end; it is the last phase of Comte's thought as well as his **degenerative parable** but it also belongs to his precious philosophical legacy.
It is the **deification of man**, understood as humanity in its present, past and future being but also as culture and tradition prolonged throughout history.

The one represented in the drawing is a completely white man, **stylized** and without defined features, the personification of all humanity, now defined by Comte with the divine meaning of the "**Great Being**" for which he is also present a bright **halo** around the character's head.
Let us remember after all that the positivist doctrine favors an almost exasperated trust in man and in his abilities, concretized in technical-scientific evolution.

Even in this degenerative phase of his philosophizing, the French thinker elaborates a new positivist religion in which the **Holy Trinity** is replaced and the sign of the cross (as evidenced by the brown Latin cross on the chest of the white hominid) is re-founded on three new elements: **love**, **order** and **progress**, rendered respectively with the symbolic images of a **heart** (on the head), of a **brain** (on the right hand) and some **metal gears** (on the left hand).
A white halo enhances the silhouette of the individual and his divinization.

## The general layout of the drawing

The **general setting** of the drawing is usually analyzed at the beginning of its description but in this case it is understandable only after having outlined Comte's philosophical system and what the individual representations refer to.

The thematic nucleus of his thought is precisely Positive Philosophy, represented in **central position** in the sheet, as if it were in fact the heart of his philosophizing.
The highest part is instead the one inherent to Sociocracy, as it is the maximum and arrival point of his theories: this is why it is the illustration placed **highest** in the drawing.
To conclude, the lowest component of his philosophical system is precisely illustrated near the lowest extreme and is clearly the degenerative parable of the extreme divinization of man.
