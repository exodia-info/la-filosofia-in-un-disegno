# <span className='nietzsche'>NIETZSCHE</span>: THE PHILOSOPHER OF CHAOS

One of the first personalities to undermine the philosophical certainties of Western civilization was the German thinker **Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche**, one of the most important philosophers in the entire history of thought.

Nietzsche's philosophy is in fact directed towards a radical criticism of the basic beliefs of Western culture and which therefore lays the foundations for the so-called "**crisis of rationality**" (exhausted by Freud's unconscious and by relativity of Einstein). For this reason the philosopher is counted among the greatest "** masters of suspicion **" and for a long time his philosophy was erroneously interpreted as the archaic thought and founder of the future ** Nazi ideology **.
In fact, by illuminating Nietzsche's mind from behind the paper, it will be possible to observe a melting **swastika**, which is a symbol of **denazification** according to which the thought regarding the "superman" (which we will see later) is detached from any intent political: Nietzsche's mind in this sense is denazified.

## The division into phases and the lack of interpretative monopoly

Nietzsche's thought has always been considered difficult to interpret, especially due to the division into the **four phases** of his philosophizing and the lack of an interpretative monopoly to understand them by virtue of a philosophical unity.
In the drawing this general characteristic is reported in a congenial form, translating the philosophical interpretation into **figurative observation**: the illustration is in fact divided into **four parts** legible circularly (keeping the sheet straight left at the bottom, left at top, top right and bottom right).
To effectively organize the reading of the drawing, the analysis of it will also be divided into four large paragraphs, one corresponding to a phase.
The division of the four boxes is clear and seems to shatter Nietzsche's thought into four different parts, one independent of the other and mostly all upside down in different directions.

That of the inverted and independent parts refers to the **lack of interpretative monopoly**: the drawing cannot in fact be observed in a single position but must be **upside down** in order to be able to analyze it in different perspectives, exactly like Nietzsche's thought it must be read and interpreted taking into account changing views.
Following the circular reading order, each time the sheet must be turned 90 degrees to the right and the starting point of reading is precisely the passage from Nietzsche's head to the first panel (behind him).
At the end of the analysis of the drawing, the sheet will have completed a complete **counterclockwise** revolution which refers to the eternal return (circularity of time, as we will see in the third box): after all, the reading order of the boxes corresponds to the ** philosophical career** of the author and therefore also to his experience, where chronologically we still distinguish four periods; Nietzsche himself defined himself as the "**first nihilist in Europe**" (and later we will see what it is), close to accepting the eternal repetition of life, implied in the drawing.

Finally, it should be noted that the layout of the drawing aims not only to specify the difficult interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy but also the vision that the philosopher has of the world (coinciding with that of Schopenhauer): for Nietzsche the world is chaos, pain and illogic and actually the drawing has a very chaotic initial perspective, everything upside down compared to everything else.
After all, it was Nietzsche himself who was nicknamed the "**philosopher of chaos**" and this approach artistically translates the chaos of the thought and personality of this great philosopher.
As regards his ** madness **, there is no mention of it in the drawing as it must be considered as a character in its own right and irrelevant for the reading of Nietzsche and his thought.

# The first box: the youth period

The reading of the **first part** occurs by rotating the sheet of paper 90 degrees as we have already specified and the illustration must be viewed **from left to right**, even if the light of that particular eye-shaped lantern runs in the opposite direction .
The fundamental points of this part are art as a rule of investigation, the distinction between Apollonian and Dionysian and history.

## Apollonian and Dionysian: rejection and acceptance of a chaotic world

In the first phase of Nietzschean thought, **art** is used as an instrument of investigation; in particular in the writing "**Birth of tragedy**", the German philosopher uses ancient art as a revealing indicator of present Western civilization, decreeing its metaphysical nature.
This is clearly represented in the drawing by the writing "art" placed on the yellow background, as if it were "**investigation background**".
On the yellow expanse we can see the figurative translation of the fundamental distinction between **Apollonian and Dionysian**: the latter are two **artistic impulses**, typical of Greek art.

The Apollonian was initially born as a consequence of the Dionysian in order to sublimate the drama of life and it materializes in **sculptural** art and **epic poetry**: the Apollonian is embodied in the marble **statue** of **Apollo** who in the drawing is the first from the left, held above a **book** and a **parchment** of poems. _“Apollo”_ is written on the marble base of the statue, depicted with a bow, arrows and holding a stylized crown.

The Dionysian, on the other hand, is what distinguishes Greek sensitivity, that is, living and perceiving the pain of life: it is that spiritual impulse concretized in **music** and **lyrical poetry**.
The personification of the Dionysian is **Dionysus** himself, represented with a blue cloak and in the guise of a spirit emerging from the strings of a lyre (Greek music) and above the text of a **lyrical composition**.
The writing _“Dionysus”_ is written on the lyre, from whose strings musical notes also emerge.

These two spirits of Hellenistic culture act as a rejection and acceptance of the drama of life: the Apollonian is the choice of renunciation and **escape** from the world, while the Dionysian welcomes the alternative of **accepting** life as as.
Here the respective choice is represented under the respective artistic impulses: under the marble Apollo a **different world** is depicted, colored with **negative colors** compared to the neighboring ones (i.e. pink and orange, negative compared to the green and blue), therefore of the original world; the **door** depicts the actual act of escaping and taking refuge in an existence different from the real drama.
On the other hand, under the lyre of the Dionysian there is a **real world** and is accepted as such: in fact it does not present deformities or changes in color.
Nietzsche himself will favor the Dionysian attitude, characteristic of the superman: the **cup of wine** of Dionysus is in fact raised towards the third panel, the one inherent to the superman.

## The scales of Attic tragedy

In a second moment from the birth of the Apollonian and the Dionysian, they recognized a **balance** considered as a perfect relationship between themselves: the harmony we are talking about is that typical of **Attic tragedy**, represented in the form of **scales** in the illustration.

Apollo and Dionysus stand above two **plates** of a scale, connected with ropes to a structure in the shape of the **ruined façade of a Greek temple**, characterized by the writing "tragedy"; the Apollonian and the Dionysian reach that spiritual balance which translates into the surrender of the Dionysian on a theatrical stage, re-proposed as the **static equilibrium** of the scales in the drawing.
The ruined temple has a purely function of reference to Greek art, as well as to the **drama of life** and its sign enhances what we have just said and further reiterated by the presence of two theatrical **masks** in the triangular tympanum.
The **clouds** and the **wind** have a purely decorative and background function, although on the one hand they accentuate the link between art and the real world.

As time passes, this balance will decline, favoring the Apollonian and mystifying the experience of existential drama: this also explains the presumed **decadence of Western civilization** that Nietzsche wants to focus on, desiring the dawn of a new present Attic tragedy.

## History at the service of life

However, by running to the right it is necessary to partially change the type of reading, thus now looking at the drawing from right to left, consistently with the light of the particular **lantern**.
The latter is the **vision of history** and it must be placed at the service of life: after all this concept summarizes what Nietzsche did with the Apollonian and the Dionysian, where the Greek history of these two ancient spirits is used to explain the decadence of a present civilization.

For the reasons just mentioned, it is the **yellow light** of the lantern that acts as a **background** for the illustration of the Apollonian-Dionysian relationship, while the lantern itself is supported by a **world map** with red writing _“life”_: on the one hand it is the same world accepted by the Dionysian attitude and therefore the Western world which explains its decadence with history, on the other hand indicating its luminous ray; on the other hand he is a direct representative of the drama of the present life that lives in the world and that once again uses history as an instrument at its service.
The lantern, as one might imagine, is instead the one that illuminates history itself (as its writing testifies) and the **eye** from which the light comes out is the observation of the past and its consideration.

## The three lenses of the relationship with history

In order to understand how we should look at the past, Nietzsche expands a vast criticism of **historicism** and historio-graphism, accusing them of an excessive attachment to history which compromises the creative power in the present.
For this reason the philosopher rejects three relationships with history, considered separately wrong: monumental, antiquarian and critical history, reported in the drawing as lenses used by the eye of historical interpretation to observe the past.

• The **<span style={{color: 'green'}}>green</span>** lens is **monumental** history, that is, those who look at the past recognizing it **hopefully** (green colour) masters and **models** to follow that he clearly does not see in the present.
The **hand** with the index finger raised is a symbol of **wisdom** and therefore an example but with a **clock** placed side by side it becomes a model that challenges **time**, therefore a past example admired in the present.

• The **<span style={{color: 'red'}}>red</span>** lens is the **antique** history, typical of those who look at the past with **love** (red color ) and trust, so much so as to recognize itself as the fruit of a historical tradition: needless to say that this love for what has happened is expressed in the iconography of a **heart**.

• The **<span style={{color: 'blue'}}>blue</span>** lens is the **critical** story, i.e. a **melancholic** relationship (blue color) between man and the past, according to which the former wants to definitively untie himself from the latter, perceived as a **weight**: consequently the blue weight with a melancholic expression placed on the **scales** fully acquires its meaning.

Nietzsche specifies that these three visions are **incorrect separately**, but if **merged together** they constitute the most correct gaze there is towards the past: for this reason the luminous ray that serves as the background for the illustration previous one (which is therefore also a representation of the concept of history), is **filtered** by all three lenses, sometimes even varying color shades between one glass and another.

# The second box: the Enlightenment period

We end up turning the sheet of paper 90 degrees to the right again and thus analyzing the box of the **second period**, the **enlightenment** in which art is completely devalued and therefore placed under a negative judgment by the * *science** elevated to a tool of analysis, as evidenced by the writing "**Gaia Scienza**".

The **genealogical** method used by Nietzsche leads the thinker to eradicate some secular beliefs of Western civilization starting from their roots, as happens in the writing "**Human, too human**": it is in fact the period of philosophizing more critical and **destructive** Nietzschean style, whose "vigorousness" is expressed by the choice of the **red background**.

## God's coffin and the rift between what was and what will be

The most important point of the second phase of Nietzsche's thought is the disturbing reflection on the **death of God**, considered the personification of man's ultimate certainties and an otherworldly perspective (escape from the world).

That of God is a death represented in the form of a **closed coffin** which distances itself from the real death of God in Christian culture, that is, on the cross. Obviously the illustration highlights the secular character of that death, understood as the end of a millenary metaphysical illusion and which therefore has very little to do with the Christian crucifixion and therefore decrees the absence of God in Nietzschean philosophy (although the small Latin cross refers to his cult, criticized by the philosopher).
Furthermore, the iconography does not present **anything that refers to possible explanations** advanced by the German philosopher in favor of the demonstration of the death of God; any demonstration of him is superfluous since reality itself understood as "chaotic existence" necessarily brings with it a de-divinization.

The coffin in the center with the writing _"God"_ **divides the frame in half**, causing a **fracture** above itself that separates "**what was from what will be**": this statement must not be understood from a historical point of view but from a **philosophical-conceptual** point of view.

The death of God is in fact an intellectual awareness and not a dramatic historical event, according to which the abandonment of the idea regarding the existence of a divinity leads to further awareness that destroys other millenary beliefs (what was) and in the meantime identifies the constructive part of Nietzschean thought (what will be).
The “**new conceptual formulations**” are anticipated with their fertile ground on the left side, bordering the third box, while the “destroyed component” is on the right side.

## The chest of values and the figure of the donkey

To begin, let's analyze what is **before** the coffin (looking from right to left): we have a burning chest and a donkey.

The **chest in the flames** bears the writing _“values”_ and is being consumed by fire: these are **values linked to the image of God** and elevated to perfections to be contemplated, but now devalued as true metaphysical illusions. The trunk therefore burns in conjunction with the death of the origin of the values that it itself contains, such as God.
Precisely because it is the bearer of this concept, the trunk appears again in the lower right corner in the fourth panel, in which the so-called "ethical-religious idols" definitively recognize their perishing (but we will see this later).
Furthermore, we must also remember his role in evoking the ** self-suppression of morality **, according to which by valuing the honesty prophesied by Christian morality it has come to oppress the same Christian-Platonic values.

On the other hand, typical of Nietzsche's Enlightenment period is the use of the two moments of the "**critical and historical-genealogical method**" which elevates the "**suspicion**" to a rule of investigation, through which the values that are burning in the wooden chest are first traced back to their historical origin (and therefore the refutation of their eternity) and then criticized as products of vile interests (and therefore the refutation of their absoluteness). The trunk therefore also takes up the critical method more generally (or rather the object of the critical method), but certainly not the two procedural moments just explained which are the methodology of Nietzsche's thought and not the thought itself, treated precisely in the drawing.

The **donkey**, on the other hand, is an expression of the rejection of any **surrogate for God**, whose symbolism was used precisely in this function by nineteenth-century atheism.
God is dead and must in no way be replaced by yet another eternal and consecrated idol.

## The end of Platonic dualism and the true world

Another personality in Nietzsche's sights and according to his vision also responsible for the affirmation of the Apollonian on the Dionysian is **Plato**: the latter is the creator of a thought that is somewhat devaluative towards the real world, that is say the belief in the **true world**, the so-called "Hyperuranium" by Plato, the seat of ideas, eternal and absolute entities that shape the things of the concrete world.
In Plato we therefore read a **dualism** which according to Nietzsche must in no way be buried together with Platonism itself as it is once again an escape from the drama of life.

In the drawing everything is rendered by the presence of **two worlds**, characterized by **slightly different** colours: the so-called "true world" considered as a contrasting belief in the Dionysian acceptance of the world is depicted on the right, in 'act of **dissolving**; while the concrete world is a simple globe colored with lighter shades (revaluation) and is depicted to the left of God's coffin.
The end of the true world represents not only the end of an illusory dualism, but also the revaluation of our own world, which although it is chaos and imperfection must be accepted as it is in Nietzsche's (Dionysian) beliefs.

## The philosophy of the morning: the fertile ground for “the Übermensch”

Therefore moving our gaze to the left, the meaning of the **picture** and the **little character** above the terrestrial globe remain to be clarified: it is the "philosophy of the morning" and the anticipation of the superman, defined by Nietzsche as specifically “Übermensch”.

The **morning philosophy** considers life as an indefinite transience and as free experimentation, free from any metaphysical illusion and **open to the creation** of new values produced by the superman.
The concept of "**morning**" typical of this philosophy is expressed in the painting at the bottom left, which shows a landscape at dawn**, the light of which enhances the dark silhouette of a **wayfarer* *; it is the free spirit, that is, the one who, thanks to science, manages to emancipate himself from past constraints and celebrate the creative atmosphere of the philosophy of the morning.
It is no coincidence that the traveler is the protagonist of the "**tale of the mad man**", full of significant symbols in which the death of God is dramatized.

It is precisely on this **fertile ground** that the advent of the **superman** and his free planning of existence is announced: the latter, although the protagonist of the next box, plays a definable anticipatory role in the illustration of the enlightenment period.
It stands, almost like a god, above the real and concrete world: on the one hand this symbolizes the Dionysian **acceptance** of the drama that distinguishes that world itself and is necessary in the definition of the Übermensch; on the other hand the superman seems to take on the role of god but it is important to specify that he does not have the role of god and in fact the replacement lies in the fact that now the metaphysical-eternal values have been lost with the death of God and the new ** free creator** of values is no longer just any eternal wine but the superman himself.
As evidence of what we have just said, above the stylized figure of the Übermensch there are a **hammer** and a **wrench**, i.e. creation and manufacturing tools (which would now symbolically produce values).

# The third panel: the period of Zarathustra

The continuity between the second and **third phase** of Nietzsche's thought is configured in avoiding turning the drawing over again: we have reached the **constructive** component of Nietzsche's philosophy, expressed in the most famous work of the German thinker entitled “**Thus Spoke Zarathustra**” in which the philosopher undertakes to deal with the theme of the superman with all his characteristics through the words of the ancient Persian prophet **Zarathustra**, privileged as the first genius in history to identify the error of morality (Zarathustra is therefore not the superman but the one who clarifies his characteristics).

It is no coincidence that in the foreground, a **bearded figure** places a hand on the edge of the drawing with his fingers outside the outlines: it is Zarathustra himself, illuminated by yellow outlines and indicating the rest of the illustration above, namely * *illustrate from outside** of thought what is seen.
The box is **blue**, a color opposite to red as it contrasts with the destructive attitude of the previous phase.

## Camel, lion and child: the inauguration of the overman

Zarathustra's first speech is entitled "**The three metamorphoses**" in which Nietzsche uses three symbolic figures to explain the genesis and meaning of the superman (a freedom that liberates itself): the **camel**, or the 'man who suffers the weight of tradition; the **lion** is instead the man free from the constraints of ethics and metaphysics; finally the **child** is the superman, or rather the **Übermensch**.
In the drawing these figures can be read from bottom to top, where the **blond hair** and the **blue eye** of the Übermensch constitute the coincidence between the latter and the child himself.

However, Nietzsche clarifies how in reality we should speak of "**overman**" rather than a superman (this is also the real meaning of the German word _"Übermensch"_ reported on the **band** of the character's blue robe in question).
In fact, the superman is a philosophical concept that Nietzsche uses as the concretization of a subject where his thoughts are embodied: he certainly lives in a "beyond the future", that is, beyond any typology of man (or rather, anthropological being) and for this reason the child in the guise of the overman has various characteristics that distance him from a classic human being.
His **white complexion** indicates that it is not flesh and blood but philosophical thought, while his hands are placed incorrectly but apparently this error is not visible: the **thumb** is facing the observer even though the palm of the hand looks upwards (a truly superhuman character).
To conclude, the Übermensch appears in the same and more detailed form as in the second box: with the blue tunic (in contrast with the previous red one for the reasons already explained) and with the classic pose of a god ( already specified above).

## "Yes"

Next to the head of the Übermensch hangs a wooden sign showing two different alternatives, _“yes”_ and _“no”_; however, a **green check** highlights the choice of the superman, that of **"yes"**.
This "yes" is aimed at two different proposals, concretized in the **hands of the character**: the acceptance of existence and the acceptance of the eternal return (which we will see in the next paragraph).

The first of the two proposals is depicted on the left hand, i.e. the one already explained regarding the acceptance of the **drama of life**: as we have already specified, Nietzsche favors the Dionysian spirit directed towards the admission of life as it is and is the basic characteristic that describes the personality of the philosophical concept of the Übermensch.
On the left hand there is therefore symbolically a **shattered world**, or the concretization of the _"chaos"_ of existence as reported on the sign, accepted by the superman and therefore supported by him.

On the right hand there is a depiction of the eternal return which, however, must be analyzed separately.

## Eternal return

On the right hand of the superman there is an **hourglass that turns upside down**: this is the metaphor used by Nietzsche to indicate the **eternal return** of the same, that is, the continuous repetition of existence.

Initially, the philosopher speaks through Zarathustra's words about the eternal return, imagining that one day the reader will be made a rather unusual **proposal** by a devil: to experience the eternal repetition of what has already been experienced.
Here the figure of the **demon** emerges behind the rotating hourglass and next to it a **question mark** as a sign of a proposal addressed to the Übermensch whose acceptance marks the very existence of the superman. This explains why the character holds up with both hands those two elements explained so far: it is a sign of acceptance that normal men would not welcome.

However, in order to understand the courage taken in accepting the eternal repetition of a chaotic and suffering existence, Nietzsche uses the speech entitled "**the vision and the enigma**": with the words of Zarathustra, the philosopher imagines a vision of the Persian prophet based on the horrid scene of a **sleeping shepherd** who wakes up to find himself with a **snake in his throat**, depicted under the hourglass held by the Übermensch.
The black snake is a symbol of eternity and in fact its body entwines to form the ** symbol of infinity **.
The courage to accept the eternal return is the same that the shepherd must do to free himself from the snake: it involves biting it so hard as to separate the head in the throat from the undulating body and then spitting out the head of the reptile. In Zarathustra's vision this happens and the consequence is the shining smile of the shepherd freed from the suffering caused by the serpent, coinciding with the freedom perceived and experienced by the superman.
The **head of that snake** is not only represented next to the image of the shepherd (which however represents an a priori moment with respect to the expulsion of that same head) but also as hanging from the "yes" sign, as the bite means courageously saying “yes” to the eternal return.
Furthermore, the superman's mouth is dirty with **blood** as if to conclude that it was he who metaphorically took that courageous bite on the black reptile's head.

We can therefore say that the entire box is aimed at clarifying the **characteristics of the Übermensch**, or rather what it accepts but not exactly all of them as we will see in the last period.

# The fourth box: the last Nietzsche

We have come to analyze the fourth and **last box**, which can only be read by rotating the sheet 90 degrees to the right this time.
The last period of Nietzsche's philosophizing is characterized by the large quantity of themes addressed and explained in the drawing according to a pure personal interpretation: they follow one another in an **ideological path** that originates from the painting of a twilight and ends in an area surrounded by observing faces.
In fact, in order we proceed by addressing the twilight of ethical-religious idols, morality, nihilism, the will to power and perspectivism, clarified in the works written by Nietzsche and entitled "Beyond Good and Evil", "Genealogy of morality”, “Twilight of the Idols” and others.

Due to the quantity of topics to be analyzed in such a short space, in many cases a **figurative synthesis** was used, i.e. making multiple concepts coincide in a single representation.

It is also important to specify that in the middle of reading the box there is a further 90 degree reversal to the right which brings the drawing straight with respect to the profile of the philosopher's portrait and refers to a "change of gravity" linked to a personal and figurative interpretation of the Nietzsche's thought, therefore nothing to do with the meaning of the rotations carried out up to now.

## The Twilight

The blue path that runs through the entire panel originates from the **river course in the canvas** at the far right: it represents the definitive **sunset of the ethical-religious idols** in a true figurative presentation that takes into account the "**dusk**".

The latter is only an expression used by Nietzsche to definitively refute morality with its values; it is therefore an imaginary and metaphorical sunset, therefore **not real** as demonstrated by the exchange of colors on the canvas of the sunset painting.
In fact, it unnaturally presents the light in the highest part of the sky and the bluish darkness in the lower part, near the sun: the position of the lights is therefore illogical and inverted, distant from reality like the metaphor used by its author.

Note in the lower corner in the foreground, the depiction of a part of the **chest containing the valuables** and represented burning in the second panel: it is in fact a definitive defeat against those idols linked to God, as they are not only ethical but also religious and the trunk has just stopped burning, **torn by the flames**.

## Morality and its genealogical analysis

Nietzsche, in the introduction to the topic of ethical-religious idols, speaks of morality and its values as projections of human tendencies and that the voice of conscience that leads to the exercise of that same morality is actually **projection of social authorities* * (or flock, i.e. of the many) in the individual.
From here the subsequent path of the blue beam is explained. Passes through a **crown** and reaches a **cavity in the white man** (in which different meanings will coincide as we will see).
The cavity is crown-shaped, as if to indicate that the shape in front fits perfectly if the ribbon were to be pulled to the left: this is the discussion just made, according to which the morality exercised by the white character (any human being) is born precisely from that cavity projected by the crown-shaped silhouette, symbol of authority.

In order to delve deeper into the decline of morality, Nietzsche traces its **psychological origin** (psychology considered by the philosopher as the "mistress of the sciences"), specifying the error in its genealogy.
In fact, the philosopher states how morality was originally based on values of strength, virtue and health; it is the expression of a chivalrous aristocracy and enclosed under the name of "**morals of the lords**".
It is depicted at the top of the box, almost in an **isolated compartment** and with a yellow background: you can see the figure of a **warrior**, flanked by the **sword** and the **shield** , symbols of honorable strength and referring to the values of the nearby table.
The latter has the title _“morale dei lords”_ and below it the values previously mentioned.

Continuing with Nietzsche's genealogical analysis, the German thinker maintains that with the passage of time the so-called "**slave morality**" was born, whose maximum expression is Christianity: this oppressive morality arises from the priestly class, which over the course of history a strong resentment or secret envy began to harbor towards the warrior, who managed to successfully achieve all the values of the morality to which the priests were initially also aimed (however observing the virtues of the spirit unlike the warriors). This secret feeling of revenge led to the establishment of "slave morality", that is, a category of values opposed to that of the lords.

Let us therefore flip the drawing 180 degrees and observe the iconography: a **suffering priest** observes with **envy** the image (now upside down) of the warrior, while he remains locked in a **cage** flanked by a wooden **Latin cross** and a **goblet** of wine, symbols of **Christianity** with which the overlying "slave morality" reached its maximum affirmation. The sacred character is accentuated by the presence of two **candles**.
The cage and the notion of _"sin"_, reported on the cage itself, still remain to be specified: the **sin** imposed by Christianity is that gun pointed at the temple which leads men not to live life in a liberating condition but rather with a constant feeling of guilt.
This explains the self-entrapment of the priest in the cage: his own **freedom** is put at risk by virtue of sin.

It is important to specify that the reversal carried out in order to fully read Nietzsche's genealogical analysis on morality has nothing to do with the meaning of the previous rotations: it is in fact a matter of rotating the sheet of paper 180 degrees, therefore **reversing it completely ** since the values of the morality of the slaves (on which the illustration is based) are **opposite** to those of the morality of the lords, thus translating its "opposition" into an "upside down".

## The two meanings of nihilism

Proceeding with our blue path, we arrive at the figure of a **white man** with a crown-shaped cavity (the meaning of which has already been specified in the previous paragraph).
The man appears with ** hands on his head **, as a sign of desperation while he observes ** Jesus on the cross ** with a ** dissolving world ** behind him.
These are depictions with multiple functions: first of all it is to clarify the two meanings that Nietzsche gives to "nihilism".

According to a first formulation it is **escape and disgust** towards the world and it is embodied in **Christianity** and **Platonism**: consequently the number _“1°”_ above the Latin cross of Jesus acquires its full meaning together with the world behind it that dissolves, that is, Plato's true world already addressed in the second box.

The white man, on the other hand, has the number _“2°”_ on his left shoulder: according to a later formulation, Nietzsche states that nihilism expresses the feeling of **dismay in the face of emptiness** caused by the perishing of absolute values and eternally linked to God.
The man (who is a generic man and therefore depersonalized and completely white) puts his hands on his head as a sign of desperation in the face of the "**death of God**" and the "**end of the true world** ”.

The complex depiction therefore highlights how until now the white man is not only a symbol of the projection of morality into the individual but also the personification of the second meaning of nihilism; on the other hand instead what that man who observes becomes the object of dismay, or rather the object of the authentic feeling of nihilism (the second meaning of which will be maintained by the philosopher) but also recalls the first meaning of nihilism itself.
Consequently, the death of God for which that man suffers would never have been represented with the secular coffin of the second panel but with the **Latin cross** on which the son of God died, as it also wants to refer to the ** Christian culture** (unlike the coffin).

The path proceeds leaving behind what Nietzsche calls "**the misunderstanding of nihilism**": that is, stating that without those eternal values linked to God and ethical idols, the world no longer has any meaning and that therefore that feeling of emptiness continues over time (always clarified by the desperate white man).

From **incomplete nihilism** to complete nihilism
Nietzsche also expresses himself on the different types of nihilism: it is mainly divided into "incomplete" and "complete".

Incomplete nihilism is embodied one last time in the man with the white body: his sense of emptiness (also identifiable in the cavity that tears him) leads him to establish new idols and establish new forms of truth, however in the design it has wanted to play with the sense of "incompleteness" whereby that man is **hollow** not only due to the projection of the crown in front, but also because he is incomplete, exactly like the **form of nihilism he embodies**.

The second typology is **complete nihilism**, that is, the great **golden key** (which as we will see mainly contains within itself the representation of the will to power) whose extension seems to be **divided in half** and the two parts joined by a **scotch**: we play once again on the sense of "completeness", that is, that that key is intact and therefore complete like its form of nihilism.

This type of nihilism is the most authentic one according to Nietzsche and it can be divided into passive (basking in nothingness) and active (violent force of destruction of ancient values).
In particular, in the drawing the form of complete nihilism presented is the extreme one of **active**, that is, extreme nihilism, understood as the destruction of every minimal residual belief: it is **the flame lit on the blue ribbon** tied to the key “complete” (it is in fact a form of complete nihilism to which it is figuratively linked), a symbol of **destruction of values** as the second panel with its burning trunk has already shown.

The other ribbon is placed in a particular position: it is a change in gravity which congenially describes the "beyond" which we will talk about later.
However, what is linked to the other end of the ribbon is ideologically complete classical nihilism, that is, its highest form which passes from the destructive moment to the **creative** one (change of gravity): the **brick** linked in fact is a symbol of constructiveness, while the **hammer** and the **wrench** are also tools that refer to the constructive act but in a more clear way towards the superman, since in the second box they were placed above him with the same colors as now and exalted the creation of a new sense of the world.

## The change in gravity and the "beyond" of the Übermensch

Continuing with the ideal path, we leave behind the transitory state of nihilism and arrive at the image of an **open green door**.
In fact, nihilism is the preparatory "**no to life**" for the "**absolute yes**" of the Übermensch, whose image is shown for the third time in the drawing above the **jamb** of the door.
All this refers to the fact that crossing the threshold of the door means inaugurating a "**beyond**" typical of the superman.
The horizon line of the **green hill is interrupted** and with it also the illustration of nihilism: beyond the green door of the superman **gravity changes** and the drawing is brought back to its original perspective, coinciding with the portrait by Nietzsche.
The change in gravity accentuates the "beyond" we talked about and is the reason why the cord of "classical nihilism" hangs according to another **force of gravity**, overturned by 90 degrees.

The iconography of the door, the choice of the change of gravity and the concept of the beyond are all linked to a personal and figurative interpretation of the thought of the last Nietzsche and above all they establish that fundamental passage in order to understand the path that distinguishes the last box.
Note that the door has an **open lock** with the key in the foreground, a representation of the "will to power", a characteristic pillar of the Übermensch.

## The key to the will to power

The door of the overman is wide open thanks to the action of the **will to power**, a key that has been inserted into the lock of the door of the overman: Nietzsche theorizes the characteristics of the will to power according to three different meanings that distinguish the creative activity and the existence of the superman; they are represented in the **seal of the key head**, which is precisely **tripartite**.

• The **yellow** writing _“Über”_ literally means “**beyond**” in German and marks the will to power as a drive towards self-affirmation, the self-overcoming of life itself, a continuous ** going beyond oneself**: the overman is "beyond" not only understood in the relationship with existing anthropological forms but also for this continuous push beyond oneself.
Everything can be effectively summarized in the following writing.

• The **blue** part depicts a **brush piercing the dial of a watch**: it is the will to power as a creative essence that plans existence in a completely free way and which at the same time completes the called “**redemption of time**” already seen in the eternal return.
The superman redeems time with his creation and with accepting the eternal repetition of the same, freed from the past which does not appear to be unchangeable but is also subject to the constructive attitude of the Übermensch: this explains the brush (attitude creative) who breaks the clock by piercing it (defeat of the flow of time as redemption occurs).
The brush exalts the **figure of the artist**, favored by Nietzsche as the first figure most similar to the constructive attitude of the superman.

• The **red** part instead has a **crown with a swastika on it** as Nietzsche states how the will to power is also **domination** and oppression of the stronger over the inferior: this is darkly a reactionary extreme of Nietzsche's thought and anti-democratic which will then be misunderstood in his political practice with the **Nazi ideology**, whose symbolic swastika is shown on the crown, a symbol of domination.

The colors used are the **primary colors**: yellow, blue and red. After all, they have their strong role since the will to power is a primary characteristic of the superman.

## The faces and lights of perspectivism

Beyond the green door we have a series of **different color profiles**: the identity of the characters is not specified (they are generalized individuals) and their **eyes** appear to be **headlights** from which they emerge of **light rays** that intersect.

This is Nietzsche's depiction of **perspectivism**, treated as one of the last arguments.
The philosopher states that there are no things or facts, but only interpretations inherent to them according to which everyone **observes the world** from their own perspective angle: the concept of perspective is rendered with light rays and each face is **different in color and greatness** since everyone is different and has their own perspective different from others.
According to Nietzsche, therefore, the world does not have a sense in itself, but innumerable senses born from the needs of each individual who observes it.
The substantial and interpretative center of the world such as the **I**, the theoretical fulcrum of idealism, is thus eliminated and in fact it too is hit by the luminous rays of interpretations as demonstrated by the drawing.

However, Nietzsche clarifies that not all interpretations of the same world are correct: for this reason, the concepts of **health** and **strength** are specific to the superman, having become criteria of choice that avoid conflicts between perspectives and the will to power.
The latter in fact escape the lights of the light rays, unlike the _"I"_ and the blue ribbon (turned green with yellow) and are brought back in the form of a **white board** in the foreground. They are a way of being of the superman and two precise iconographies (cross for health and arm with muscle for strength) highlight their meaning.

## The billiard balls

Before definitively concluding the journey into Nietzsche's thought, it is important to talk about the two **billiard balls** placed under his chin.
In the last period Nietzsche will criticize a lot of methods, doctrines and philosophies (which for reasons of space are not reported in the drawing) but certainly the most important is the **criticism of the principle of causality**, already carried out by **David Hume ** according to which determinism and the order of phenomena that populate the existent is something created by man and not real.

Hume, who is explicitly taken up by Nietzsche, uses the figurative image of two billiard balls to explain what we have just said: the phenomenon of the **yellow ball** hitting the **black ball** would lead one to think that it it moves by spinning in the hole, but until it happens in the present and even if it has happened countless times in the past, it cannot be established with certainty. The order in this phenomenon was established by man due to a need to **establish regularity**, but it is an order that does not really exist according to Hume.
The philosopher of chaos supports this theory fully and the metaphor of billiard balls takes part in his thought as an important component.
A final characteristic of billiard balls are the **numbers used** and completely non-existent in the game with the cue: they are the days of birth and death of Nietzsche, born on **15 October 1844** (one day before about me eheh) and died on **25 August 1900**.
